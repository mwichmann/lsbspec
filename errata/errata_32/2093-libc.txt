Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.2
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2093

Rationale: additional errors and incomplete descriptions were
discovered in the getgrouplist() function, after the changes in
bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1639
were applied to edition 3.1.1 of this specification.

In section 13.5. Interface Definitions for libc

section Description,

Change:

   shall also be included.

to:

   shall also be included in the values returned in groups. It is
   expected that group would be specified as the user's primary
   group from the password file (obtainable via getpwnam() or a
   similar function).


section Return Value,

Change:

   If on entry the value referenced by ngroups was less than to
   the number of supplementary group identifiers, getgrouplist()
   shall return -1. The initial *ngroups entries in groups may be
   overwritten.

to:

   If on entry the value referenced by ngroups was less than the
   number of supplementary group identifiers, getgrouplist() shall
   return -1. The initial ngroups entries in groups shall be
   overwritten.


Change:

   If user does not refer to a valid user on the system,
   getgrouplist() shall return 1, and set the value referenced by
   ngroups to 1, reflecting the group supplied as group.

to:

   If the number of groups exceeds the input ngroups value, then
   as well as returning -1, ngroups shall be set to the number of
   groups that would have been placed in groups if it had been
   large enough.

     Note: In such a case, the caller can use the information
     returned to make a further getgrouplist() call with a
     correctly sized groups array.

   If user does not refer to a valid user on the system, then the
   behavior of this function is undefined.
