Specification: LSB Core generic
Specification: LSB Core IA32, IA64, PPC32, PPC64, S390, S390X, AMD64
Edition of Specification: 3.2
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1912

Rationale: scalbf and scalbl were attributed to the wrong specification,
while listed as ISOC99 it should be listed as this specification, with
documention in place.


In LSB Core generic:

In 13.8. Interface Definitions for libm

Add to Table of Contents:

   scalbf -- load exponent of radix-independent floating point number
   scalbl -- load exponent of radix-independent floating point number


Add:

scalbf

Name

   scalbf -- load exponent of radix-independent floating point
   number

Synopsis

   #include <math.h>

   float scalbf(float x, double exp);

Description

   The scalbf() function is identical to scalb(), except that the
   argument x and the return value is of type float.

Returns

   See scalb().

scalbl

Name

   scalbl -- load exponent of radix-independent floating point
   number

Synopsis

   #include <math.h>

   long double scalbl(long double x, double exp);

Description

   The scalbl() function is identical to scalb(), except that the
   argument x and the return value is of type long double.

Returns

   See scalb().
