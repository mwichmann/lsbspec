Specification: LSB Desktop generic
Edition of Specification: 3.2
Type: Editorial
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1943

Rationale: three interfaces were included in error; they cannot be used
and do not appear in the reference documentation. The interfaces are
    QGCache( const QGCache & );  (two mangled names for this)
    QGCache &operator=( const QGCache & );


In LSB Desktop generic:

In 17.2.35.8. Interfaces for Qt3 Internals
   Table 17-657. libqt-mt - Qt3 Internals Function Interfaces
