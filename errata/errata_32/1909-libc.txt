Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.2
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1909

Rationale: the gethostbyname2() function erroneously listed the
gethostbyname_t() function in the Return Value section and indicated
a zero return on success, while the function should be described as
returning a hostent structure.


In LSB Core Generic:

13.5. Interface Definitions for libc
Interface gethostbyname_r, section Return Value

replace:

   On success, the gethostbyname_r() function shall return zero.
   If the return value was ERANGE, the size of the buffer buf,
   indicated by buflen, was too small. If the gethostbyname_r()
   function returns returns any other value, then the variable
   referenced by h_errnop shall be set to indicate the cause as
   for gethostbyname().

with:

   On success, the gethostbyname_r() function shall return a
   pointer to a hostent structure if the requested entry was
   found, and a null pointer otherwise.

   On unsuccessful completion, gethostbyname_r() shall set h_errno

add:

Errors

   The gethostbyname_r() shall set h_errno as for gethostbyname()
   in ISO POSIX (2003).
