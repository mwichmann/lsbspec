Specification: LSB Core Generic
Specification: LSB Core IA32, IA64, PPC32, PPC64, S390, S390X, AMD64
Edition of Specification: 3.2
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved, new text
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2425

Rationale: the specification incorrectly requires that __xmknod be called
with an invariant value of 1 or the results are undefined. In fact,
this value varies based on architecture. Some other minor corrections
are also needed.

In LSB Core Generic:

In 13.5. Interface Definitions for libc

Change:

   __xmknod -- make block or character special file

to:

   __xmknod -- make a special file
 

In the interface definitions for __xmknod,
Section Name, change:

   __xmknod -- make block or character special file

To:

   __xmknod -- make a special file

Section Synopsis, insert:
 
   #include <sys/stat.h>

 
Section Description, change:
 
   The __xmknod() function shall implement the mknod() interface
   from ISO POSIX (2003).

   The value of ver shall be 1 or the behavior of __xmknod() is
   undefined.

   __xmknod(1, path, mode, dev) shall behave as mknod(path, mode,
   dev) as specified by ISO POSIX (2003).

To:

   The __xmknod() function shall implement the mknod() interface.
   The behavior of __xmknod() for values of ver other than
   _MKNOD_VER is undefined. See Data Definitions in the
   architecture specific part of this specification for the
   correct value of _MKNOD_VER.

   __xmknod(_MKNOD_VER, path, mode, dev) shall behave as
   mknod(path, mode, dev) as specified by ISO POSIX (2003).
