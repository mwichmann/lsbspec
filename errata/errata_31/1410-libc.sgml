Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1
Type: Editorial
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1410

Rationale: definitions of SIOCGIFNAME, SIOCGIFDSTADDR, SIOCGIFBRDADDR
and SIOCGIFMTU macros omitted or partially present. All four
macros missing in Data Definitions; SIOCGIFDSTADDR and SIOCGIFNAME
missing in Interface Definitions.


Section: 13.4. Data Definitions for libc
13.4.58. sys/socket.h

Add to the other SIOCG* macros:

#define SIOCGIFNAME     0x8910
#define SIOCGIFDSTADDR  0x8917
#define SIOCGIFBRDADDR  0x8919
#define SIOCGIFMTU      0x8921


Section: 13.5. Interface Definitions for libc

under: sockio -- socket ioctl commands
add:

   SIOCGIFDSTADDR
          Get the point-to-point address for the given interface.
          argp  shall point to a ifreq structure. Before calling,
          the  caller  should fill in the ifr_name field with the
          interface  name, and upon return, the ifr_dstaddr field
          is set with the point-to-point address.

   SIOCGIFNAME
          Get  the  name  of  an interface. argp shall point to a
          ifreq structure. Before calling, the caller should fill
          in the ifr_ifindex field with the number (index) of the
          interface,  and  upon return, the ifr_name field is set
          with the interface name.
