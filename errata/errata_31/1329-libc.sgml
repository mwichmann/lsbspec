Edition of Specification: 3.1
Type: Editorial
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1329


Rationale: strnlen wording is not clear; references to string
where the array of characters need not be null-terminated.


Section:  13.5. Interface Definitions for libc

Interface strnlen, section Description,

Change:

   strnlen() returns the number of characters in the string s,
   not including the terminating \0 character, but at most
   maxlen. In doing this, strnlen() looks only at the first
   maxlen characters at s and never beyond s + maxlen.

To:

   The strnlen() function shall compute the number of bytes in the
   array to which s points, stopping at maxlen bytes. A null byte
   and any bytes following it are not counted.


Interface strnlen, section Return Value,

Change:

   strnlen() returns strlen(s), if that is less than maxlen, or
   maxlen if there is no \0 character among the first maxlen
   characters pointed to by s.

To:

   The strnlen() function shall return the length of s if that is
   less than maxlen, or maxlen if there is no null byte in the first
   maxlen bytes.
