Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1
Type: Error
Status: Approved for TC#1
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1336

Rationale: two structure members had a type different than
required by ISO POSIX and in use by implementations.

Section:  13.4. Data Definitions for libc

13.4.80. wordexp.h

Change:

typedef struct {
    int we_wordc;
    char **we_wordv;
    int we_offs;
} wordexp_t;

To:

typedef struct {
    size_t we_wordc;
    char **we_wordv;
    size_t we_offs;
} wordexp_t;
