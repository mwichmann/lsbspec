Rationale: The svcudp_create function was incompletely defined.

Section : 13.5. Interface Definitions for libc

Interface  svcudp_create, section Description, change

   This call is equivalent to svcudp_bufcreate( sock, SZ, SZ) for
   some default size SZ.

To:

   The svcudp_create() function shall create a UDP/IP-based RPC service
   transport, and return a pointer to its descriptor. The transport is
   associated with the socket sock, which may be RPC_ANYSOCK, in which
   case a new socket shall be created. If the socket is not bound to a
   local UDP port, then svcudp_create() shall bind it to an arbitrary
   port.

   If svcudp_create() returns successfully, then the xp_sock field in
   the result shall be the transport's socket descriptor, and the xp_port
   field shall be the transport's port number.

Add section Return Value:

   Upon successful completion, svcudp_create() shall return a pointer to
   a RPC service transport; otherwise, a null pointer shall be returned.
