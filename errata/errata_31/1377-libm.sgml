Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1377

XXX More to do on this bug: fix __fpclassify* "manpages".
XXX or is that a separate bug?

Rationale: the reference specification for __fpclassifyl was incorrect.

===
In Specification LSB Core IA64:

Section 11.4.1.1 Interfaces for Math, change

   __fpclassifyl(GLIBC_2.2) [ISOC99]

to

   __fpclassifyl(GLIBC_2.2) [LSB]

===
Add new section:

Interface Definitions for libm

   Table of Contents
   __fpclassifyl -- Classify real floating type

   The interfaces defined on the following pages are included in
   libm and are defined by this specification. Unless otherwise
   noted, these interfaces shall be included in the source
   standard.

   Other interfaces listed in Section [XX] shall behave as
   described in the referenced base document.

__fpclassify

Name

   __fpclassifyl -- Classify real floating type

Synopsis

   int __fpclassifyl(long double arg);

Description

   __fpclassifyl() has the same specification as fpclassify() in
   ISO POSIX (2003), except that the argument type for
   __fpclassify() is known to be long double.

   __fpclassifyl() is not in the source standard; it is only in
   the binary standard.

===
Section A.2 libm, add to the list of Standards:

   This Specification [LSB]

In Table A-2, libm Function Interfaces, change

   __fpclassifyl[ISOC99]

to

   __fpclassifyl[LSB]
