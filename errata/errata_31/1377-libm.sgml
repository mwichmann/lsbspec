Specification: LSB Core IA64, AMD64
Edition of Specification: 3.1
Type: Editorial
Status: Unapproved, new text
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1377

Rationale: the reference specification for __fpclassifyl was incorrect.
Since the reference specification is this document, the specification
text needed to be added. After the change, this now matches how
LSB Core IA32 appears.


In Specification LSB Core IA64:

Section 11.4.1.1 Interfaces for Math, change

   __fpclassifyl(GLIBC_2.2) [ISOC99]

to

   __fpclassifyl(GLIBC_2.2) [LSB]


Add new section:

Interface Definitions for libm

   Table of Contents
   __fpclassifyl -- Classify real floating type

   The interfaces defined on the following pages are included in
   libm and are defined by this specification. Unless otherwise
   noted, these interfaces shall be included in the source
   standard.

   Other interfaces listed in Section [XX] shall behave as
   described in the referenced base document.
<XXX alternative wording>
   Other interfaces listed in Section 11.4 shall behave as
   described in the referenced base document.
</XXX>

__fpclassify
<XXX alternative wording>
__fpclassifyl
</XXX>

Name

   __fpclassifyl -- Classify real floating type

Synopsis

   int __fpclassifyl(long double arg);

Description

   __fpclassifyl() has the same specification as fpclassify() in
   ISO POSIX (2003), except that the argument type for
   __fpclassifyl() is known to be long double.

   __fpclassifyl() is not in the source standard; it is only in
   the binary standard.


Section A.2 libm, add to the list of Standards:

   This Specification [LSB]

In Table A-2, libm Function Interfaces, change

   __fpclassifyl[ISOC99]

to

   __fpclassifyl[LSB]
