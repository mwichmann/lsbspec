Specfication: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1293

Rationale: the RUSAGE_BOTH constant was defined in error
in the <sys/resource.h> header.  This is not an application-
usable constant, and in fact generates an error if passed
to the getrlimit function.


13.4.55. sys/resource.h

Remove the following define:

#define RUSAGE_BOTH     (-2)
