Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1525

Rationale: the statfs and fstatfs functions were marked as obsolete in
LSB 1.3 and removed at 2.0. However, since these interfaces provide
the only method for discovering the file system type, their removal
was regarded as premature, and they have been reinstated (together with
their obsolete status) until such time as there is a better alternative
in widespread use.

fstatfs

Name

   fstatfs -- (deprecated)

Synopsis

   #include <sys/statfs.h>

   int fstatfs(int fd, struct statfs * buf);

Description

   The  fstatfs()  function  returns  information about a mounted
   file  system.  The  file  system  is  identified by fd, a file
   descriptor  of an open file within the mounted filesystem. The
   results are placed in the structure pointed to by buf.

   Fields  that  are undefined for a particular file system shall
   be set to 0.

     Note:  Application  developers  should  use  the fstatvfs()
     function   to   obtain  general  file  system  information.
     Applications should only use the fstatfs() function if they
     must  determine  the  file  system  type, which need not be
     provided by fstatvfs().

Return Value

   On  success, the fstatfs() function shall return 0 and sed the
   fields  of  the  structure  idenfitied  by buf accordingly. On
   error,  the  fstatfs()  function shall return -1 and set errno
   accordingly.

Errors

   EBADF    fd is not a valid open file descriptor.

   EFAULT   buf points to an invalid address.

   EIO      An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
            the file system.

   ENOSYS The filesystem fd is open on does not support statfs().


fstatfs64

Name

   fstatfs64 -- (deprecated)

Synopsis

   #include <sys/statfs.h>

   int fstatfs64(int fd, struct statfs64 * buf);

Description

   The  fstatfs64()  function returns information about a mounted
   file  system.  The  file  system  is  identified by fd, a file
   descriptor  of an open file within the mounted filesystem. The
   results are placed in the structure pointed to by buf.

   Fields  that  are undefined for a particular file system shall
   be set to 0.

   fstatfs64() is the 64-bit version of fstatfs().

     Note:  Application  developers  should use the fstatvfs64()
     function   to   obtain  general  file  system  information.
     Applications  should  only  use the fstatfs64() function if
     they must determine the file system type, which need not be
     provided by fstatvfs64().

Return Value

   On  success,  the  fstatfs64() function shall return 0 and sed
   the  fields of the structure idenfitied by buf accordingly. On
   error,  the fstatfs64() function shall return -1 and set errno
   accordingly.

Errors

   See fstatfs().


statfs

Name

   statfs -- (deprecated)

Synopsis

   #include <sys/statfs.h>

   int statfs(const char *path, (struct statfs * buf));

Description

   The statfs() function returns information about a mounted file
   system.  The file system is identified by path, a path name of
   a  file  within the mounted filesystem. The results are placed
   in the structure pointed to by

   Fields  that  are undefined for a particular file system shall
   be set to 0.

     Note:  Application  developers  should  use  the  statvfs()
     function   to   obtain  general  file  system  information.
     Applications  should only use the statfs() function if they
     must  determine  the  file  system  type, which need not be
     provided by statvfs().

Return Value

   On  success,  the statfs() function shall return 0 and sed the
   fields  of  the  structure  idenfitied  by buf accordingly. On
   error,  the  statfs()  function  shall return -1 and set errno
   accordingly.

Errors

   ENOTDIR  A component of the path prefix of path is not a
            directory.

   ENAMETOOLONG  path is too long.

   ENOENT   The file referred to by path does not exist.

   EACCES   Search permission is denied for a component of the
            path prefix of path.

   ELOOP    Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
            path.

   EFAULT   buf or path points to an invalid address.

   EIO      An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
            to the file system.

   ENOMEM   Insufficient kernel memory was available.

   ENOSYS   The filesystem path is on does not support statfs().


statfs64

Name

   statfs64 -- (deprecated)

Synopsis

   #include <sys/statfs.h>

   int statfs64(const char * path, (struct statfs64 * buf));

Description

   The  statfs64()  function  returns information about a mounted
   file  system.  The  file  system is identified by path, a path
   name  of a file within the mounted filesystem. The results are
   placed in the structure pointed to by buf.

   statfs64() is the 64-bit version of statfs().

   Fields  that  are undefined for a particular file system shall
   be set to 0.

     Note:  Application  developers  should  use the statvfs64()
     function   to   obtain  general  file  system  information.
     Applications  should  only  use  the statfs64() function if
     they must determine the file system type, which need not be
     provided by statvfs64().

Return Value

   On success, the statfs64() function shall return 0 and sed the
   fields  of  the  structure  idenfitied  by buf accordingly. On
