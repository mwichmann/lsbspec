Rationale: the speed constants for the cfsetspeed function are
defined twice, in inconsistent ways.  The defines in the data
definitions section are correct; the ones in the interface
definitions section were incorrect.

Interface cfsetspeed, Section Description, change:

   cfsetspeed() sets the baud rate values in the termios
   structure. The effects of the function on the terminal as
   described below do not become effective, nor are all errors
   detected, until the tcsetattr() function is called. Certain
   values for baud rates set in termios and passed to tcsetattr()
   have special meanings.

   The cfsetspeed() function shall set the input and output
   speeds in t to the value specified by speed. The effects of
   the function on the terminal as described below do not become
   effective, nor are all errors detected, until the tcsetattr()
   function is called. Certain values for baud rates set in
   termios and passed to tcsetattr() have special meanings.
