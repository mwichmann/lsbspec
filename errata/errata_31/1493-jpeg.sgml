Rationale: two internal macros that reflect the result of
configuring the jpeg library, but do not form part of the
API/ABI, were included in error. Since these may interfere
with application usage, they are removed.

Section  : 9.2. Data Definitions for libjpeg

Section 9.2.1. jpeglib.h

Remove:

#define HAVE_STDDEF_H
#define HAVE_STDLIB_H
