Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1 Update 1
Type: Editorial
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1668

Rationale: the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is a reference specification
for this specification, and places specific requirements on the commands
gunzip and zcat.  This requirement is too strict, and is relaxed. In
addition, it was found that zcat had been inadvertently omitted from
mention in this specification (see
bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1009; this
erratum assumes the erratum for that issue was previously applied)


In 15.2. Command Behavior,

In command gunzip, section Description,

Add:

   The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard requires that if gunzip exists,
   it must be a symbolic or hard link to /bin/gzip. This
   specification additionally allows gunzip to be a wrapper script
   which calls gzip -d.


In command zcat, section Description,

Add:

   The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard requires that if zcat exists, it
   must be a symbolic or hard link to /bin/gzip. This
   specification additionally allows zcat to be a wrapper script
   which calls gzip -c -d.
