Specification: LSB Core Generic
Specification: LSB Core IA32, IA64, AMD64, PPC32, PPC64, S390, S390X
Edition of Specification: 3.1 Update 1
Type: Editorial
Status: Unapproved, new text
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1641

Rationale: the readdir64_r() interface was omitted from this
specification. The related functions readdir(), readdir64(() and
readdir_r() are all present, so for completeness the function is added
at LSB 3.2.


In LSB Core Generic:


In 13.3.18.1. Interfaces for Large File Support

Add to Table 13-28. libc - Large File Support Function Interfaces:

   readdir64_r [LSB]


In 13.4.4. dirent.h

Add:

extern int readdir64_r(DIR *, struct dirent64 *, struct dirent64 **);


In 13.5. Interface Definitions for libc

Add to Table of Contents:

      readdir64_r -- read a directory (Large File Support)


Add:

readdir64_r

Name

   readdir64_r -- read a directory (Large File Support)

Synopsis

   #include <dirent.h>

   int readdir64_r(DIR * dirp, struct dirent64 * entry, struct
   dirent64 * * result);

Description

   The readdir64_r() function is a large file version of
   readdir_r(). It shall behave as readdir_r() in ISO POSIX
   (2003), except that the entry and result arguments are dirent64
   structures rather than dirent.

Return Value

   See readdir_r().

Errors

   See readdir_r().
