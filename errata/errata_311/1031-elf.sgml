Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1 Update 1
Type: editorial
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1031

Rationale: The System V ABI Update allows implementations to set
SHF_MERGE section header flag on combinable sections, and the
SHF_STRINGS flag on such sections to indicate that they contain
null-terminated strings and not just fixed-length entries.
Implementations of this specification already may set these
flags on the .rodata and .rodata1 sections; this usage should
not be disallowed by this specification.
