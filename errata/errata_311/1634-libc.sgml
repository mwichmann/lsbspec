Specification: LSB Core Generic
Specification: LSB Core IA32, IA64, AMD64, PPC32, PPC64, S390, S390X
Edition of Specification: 3.1 Update 1
Type: Editorial
Status: Unapproved, new text
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1634

Rationale: the gethostbyname_r() function was withdrawn at LSB 3.0.
However, this interface has proven widely used in code that cannot be
easily modified and its removal was regarded as premature. Is is present
in all implementation. It is restored to this specification at LSB 3.2.

The related function gethostbyaddr_r(), which has never appeared in
this specification, was also discovered to be needed in the short term,
and is added.

Since the getaddrinfo() family is regarded as preferred for manipulating
network addresses, both of these interfaces are indicated as deprecated
and subject to removal in future versions.

Add:

gethostbyaddr_r

Name

   gethostbyaddr_r -- find network host database entry matching
   host name (DEPRECATED)

Synopsis

   #include <netdb.h>

   int gethostbyaddr_r(const void * restrict addr, socklen_t len,
   int type, struct hostent * restrict result_buf, char * restrict
   buf, size_t buflen, struct hostent * * restrict result, int *
   h_errnop);

Description

     Note: The gethostbyaddr_r() function is deprecated;
     applications should use getaddrinfo() instead.

   gethostbyaddr_r() is a reentrant version of gethostbyaddr()
   that searches the network host database for a host address
   match.

   The gethostbyaddr_r() function shall search the network host
   database for an entry of address family type with the host with
   address addr. The len argument contains the length of the
   address referenced by addr.

   If type is AF_INET, the addr argument shall be an in_addr
   structure. If type is AF_INET6, the addr argument shall be an
   in6_addr structure. If type is any other value, the behavior is
   unspecified.

   The application must provide a buffer for the gethostbyaddr_r()
   to use during the lookup process. The buffer is referenced by
   buf, and is of size buflen. If the buffer is not of sufficient
   size, gethostbyaddr_r() may fail and return ERANGE. If a
   matching entry is found in the database, gethostbyaddr_r()
   shall copy the relevant information to the application supplied
   hostent structure referenced by result_buf, and return a
   pointer to this structure in *result. If no matching entry is
   found, *result shall be set to a null pointer. Additional error
   information shall be set in the variable referenced by
   h_errnop.

Return Value

   On success, the gethostbyaddr_r() function shall return zero.
   If the return value was ERANGE, the size of the buffer buf,
   indicated by buflen, was too small. If the gethostbyaddr_r()
   function returns returns any other value, then the variable
   referenced by h_errnop shall be set to indicate the cause as
   for gethostbyaddr().


Add:

gethostbyname_r

Name

   gethostbyname_r -- find network host database entry matching
   host name (DEPRECATED)

Synopsis

   int gethostbyname_r(const char * restrict name, struct hostent
   * restrict result_buf, char * restrict buf, size_t buflen,
   struct hostent ** restrict result, int * restrict h_errnop);

Description

     Note: The gethostbyname_r() function is deprecated;
     applications should use getaddrinfo() instead.

   gethostbyname_r() is a reentrant version of gethostbyname()
   that searches the network host database for a host name match.

   The gethostbyname_r() function shall search the network host
   database for an entry with name name.

   The application must provide a buffer for the gethostbyname_r()
   to use during the lookup process. The buffer is referenced by
   buf, and is of size buflen. If the buffer is not of sufficient
   size, gethostbyname_r() may fail and return ERANGE. If a
   matching entry is found in the database, gethostbyname_r()
   shall copy the relevant information to the application supplied
   hostent structure referenced by result_buf, and return a
   pointer to this structure in *result. If no matching entry is
   found, *result shall be set to a null pointer. Additional error
   information shall be set in the variable referenced by
   h_errnop.

Return Value

   On success, the gethostbyname_r() function shall return zero.
   If the return value was ERANGE, the size of the buffer buf,
   indicated by buflen, was too small. If the gethostbyname_r()
   function returns returns any other value, then the variable
   referenced by h_errnop shall be set to indicate the cause as
   for gethostbyname().
