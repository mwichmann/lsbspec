Specification: LSB Desktop Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1 
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1727

Rationale: the gtk_toolbar_set_icon_size was excluded from this
specification because the Gtk project had erroneously marked the
interface as Deprecated in the refrerence specification.  The
reference speification has been corrected so the reason for
exclusion from LSB is invalid, and there are known applications
which require this interface.


In section 15.23.1. GTK main Widgets library,

In 15.23.1.1. Interfaces for GTK main Widgets library,

In section 15.24. Data Definitions for libgtk-x11-2.0,

In 15.24.1. gtk-2.0/gtk/gtk.h

Add

   extern void gtk_toolbar_set_icon_size(GtkToolbar *, GtkIconSize);
