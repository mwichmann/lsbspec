Specification: LSB Core S390X
Edition of Specification: 3.1 Update 1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1660

Rationale: the definition of the intptr_t type was omitted
for this architecture.

Note: while this erratum documents the type as missing from
LSB 3.1 Update 1 in <inttypes.h>, as a result of a separate
Bug (reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1660)
the missing value will appear in <stding.h> in the next
version of the specification.


In section 11.3. Data Definitions for libc,

In 11.3.10. inttypes.h

Add:

typedef long int intptr_t;
