Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1 
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1107

Rationale: "Section 16.1  /dev: Device Files" duplicates information
which is already listed in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard,
version 2.3, which is included in this specification by reference.
Remove this redundant information.


In section 16.1. /dev: Device Files,

Replace:

   The following shall exist under /dev. Other devices may also
   exist in /dev. Device names may exist as symbolic links to
   other device nodes located in /dev or subdirectories of /dev.
   There is no requirement concerning major/minor number values.

   /dev/null

   An infinite data source and data sink. Data written to this
   device shall be discarded. Reads from this device shall always
   return end-of-file (EOF).
   /dev/zero

   This device is a source of zeroed out data. All data written
   to this device shall be discarded. A read from this device
   shall always return the requested number of bytes, each
   initialized to the value '\0'.
   /dev/tty

   In each process, a synonym for the controlling terminal
   associated with the process group of that process, if any. All
   reads and writes to this device shall behave as if the actual
   controlling terminal device had been opened.

With:

   The devices described in Chapter 6. "Operating System Specific
   Annex", Section 6.1. "Linux", subsection 6.1.3. "/dev: Devices
   and special files" in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard are
   required on an LSB conforming system. Other devices may also
   exist in /dev. Device names may exist as symbolic links to
   other device nodes located in /dev or subdirectories of /dev.
   There is no requirement concerning major/minor number values.
