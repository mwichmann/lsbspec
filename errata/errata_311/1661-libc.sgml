Rationale: the sched_setscheduler function does not behave
exactly as documented in ISO POSIX (2003).  Document the difference.


In section 13.5. Interface Definitions for libc

Insert new Interface description after the "scanf" interface:


sched_setscheduler

Name

   sched_setscheduler -- set scheduling policy and parameters

Synopsis

   #include <sched.h>

   int sched_setscheduler(pid_t pid, int policy, const struct
   sched_param * param);

Description

   The sched_setscheduler() shall behave as described in ISO
   POSIX (2003), except as noted below.

Return Value

   On success, 0 is returned instead of the former scheduling
   policy.
