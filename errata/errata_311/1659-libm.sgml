Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1 Update 1
Type: Editorial
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1659

Rationale: the clog10, clog10f and clog10l functions were
described as appearing in ISO C99, however they are not
documented there.  In addition, the prototype for clog10
which was added via a previous erratum was incomplete and
needs correction.


In LSB Core Generic:

In Table of Contents, section 13.8. Interface Definitions for libm

add

              clog10 -- Logarithm of a Complex Number
              clog10f -- Logarithm of a Complex Number
              clog10l -- Logarithm of a Complex Number


In 13.6.1.1. Interfaces for Math,

   Table 13-31. libm - Math Function Interfaces

Change:

   clog10 [ISOC99] clog10f [ISOC99] clog10l [ISOC99] 

to:

   clog10 [LSB] clog10f [LSB] clog10l [LSB]


In 13.7.1. complex.h,

Change:

extern double complex clog10(void);

to:

extern double complex clog10(double complex);


In section 13.8. Interface Definitions for libm,

Table of Contents,

add:

   clog10 -- Logarithm of a Complex Number
   clog10f -- Logarithm of a Complex Number
   clog10l -- Logarithm of a Complex Number


Add these interface definitions:

clog10

Name

   clog10 -- Logarithm of a Complex Number

Synopsis

   #include <complex.h>

   double complex clog10(double complex z);

Description

   The clog10() function shall compute the base 10 logarithm of
   the complex number z.

Return Value

   The clog10() function shall return the base 10 logarithm.


clog10f

Name

   clog10f -- Logarithm of a Complex Number

Synopsis

   #include <complex.h>

   float complex clog10f(float complex z);

Description

   The clog10f() function shall compute the base 10 logarithm of
   the complex number z.

Return Value

   The clog10f() function shall return the base 10 logarithm.


clog10l

Name

   clog10l -- Logarithm of a Complex Number

Synopsis

   #include <complex.h>

   long double complex clog10l(long double complex z);

Description

   The clog10l() function shall compute the base 10 logarithm of
   the complex number z.

Return Value

   The clog10l() function shall return the base 10 logarithm.
