Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1472

Rationale: several interfaces were classified in the wrong header
file. In some cases, this was causing compilation problems in POSIX
conforming code.

open() was placed in <unistd.h>, not <fcntl.h> where ISO POSIX (2003)
documents it.  By extension, open64() should also be in <fcntl.h>.
creat() was placed in <unistd.h>, not <fcntl.h> where ISO POSIX (2003)
documents it.  By extension, creat64() should also be in <fcntl.h>.
lockf64() was placed in <fcntl.h>, not <unistd.h> where ISO POSIX (2003)
documents the base function lockf().


In 13.4.74. unistd.h,

Remove:

  extern int lockf64(int, int, off64_t);

Add:

  extern int creat(const char *, mode_t);
  extern int creat64(const char *, mode_t);
  extern int open(const char *, int, ...);
  extern int open64(const char *, int, ...);


In 13.4.74. unistd.h,

Remove:

  extern int creat(const char *, mode_t);
  extern int creat64(const char *, mode_t);
  extern int open(const char *, int, ...);
  extern int open64(const char *, int, ...);

Add:

  extern int lockf64(int, int, off64_t);
