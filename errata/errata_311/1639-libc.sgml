Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1 Update 1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1639

Rationale: several errors in definition of interface - wrong summary,
wrong behavior if user argument is invalid, wrong behavior if ngroups
is smaller than the number of groups found.


In section 13.5. Interface Definitions for libc

Table of Contents,

Change:

   getgrouplist -- get network group entry

to

   getgrouplist -- get groups a user belongs to


In the interface definition for getgrouplist,

section Name,

Change:

   getgrouplist -- get network group entry

To:

   getgrouplist -- get groups a user belongs to


section Synopsis,

Change:

   The getgrouplist() function shall fill in the array groups
   with the supplementary groups for the user specified by user.
   On entry, ngroups shall refer to an integer containing the
   maximum number of gid_t members in the groups array. The group
   group shall also be included. On success, the value referred
   to by ngroups shall be updated to contain the number of gid_t
   objects copied.

To:

   The getgrouplist() function shall fill in the array groups
   with the supplementary groups for the user specified by user.
   On entry, ngroups shall refer to an integer containing the
   maximum number of gid_t members in the groups array. The group
   group shall also be included.


section Return Value,

Change:

   On success, if there was sufficient room to copy all the
   supplementatry group identifiers to the array identified by
   groups, getgrouplist() shall return the number of gid_t
   objects copied, and the value referenced by ngroups shall be
   updated. If there was not sufficient room to copy all the
   supplementary group identifiers, grouplist() shall return -1,
   and update the value referenced by ngroups to the number
   actually copied.

To:

   If on entry the value referenced by ngroups was greater than
   or equal to the number of supplementary group identifiers to
   be copied to the array identified by groups, getgrouplist()
   shall return the number of group identifiers actually copied,
   and shall set the value referenced by ngroups to this value.

   If on entry the value referenced by ngroups was less than to
   the number of supplementary group identifiers, getgrouplist()
   shall return -1. The initial *ngroups entries in groups may be
   overwritten.


and Change:

   If user does not refer to a valid user on the system,
   getgrouplist() shall return 0, and set the value referenced by
   ngroups to 0.

To:

   If user does not refer to a valid user on the system,
   getgrouplist() shall return 1, and set the value referenced by
   ngroups to 1, reflecting the group supplied as group.
