Specification: LSB Core Generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1 Update 1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1631

Rationale: the wording describing packaging dependencies appears to
disallow depending on foundational packages such as generic support
libraries, etc.  The intent of the specification was only to make
sure the availability of dependencies was assured.


In 22.6. Package Dependencies,

Change

   Packages shall not depend on other system-provided
   dependencies. They shall not depend on non-system-provided
   dependencies unless those dependencies are fulfilled by
   packages which are part of the same application. A package may
   only provide a virtual package name which is registered to that
   application.

To

   Packages shall not depend on other system-provided
   dependencies. They shall not depend on non-system-provided
   dependencies unless the package provider also makes available
   the LSB conforming packages needed to satisfy such
   dependencies.
