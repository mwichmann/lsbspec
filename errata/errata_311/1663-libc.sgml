Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663

Rationale: the functions sigadnset, sigorset and sigisemptyset
were documented as returning an error code of -1 with errno set
to EINVAL if a NULL sigset_t is passed as any of the arguments.
In reality, this behavior is undefined, as is the behavior if
an uninitialized sigset_t is passed.


In section 13.5. Interface Definitions for libc

Interface sigandset, section Description, add at end:

   Applications shall call sigemptyset() or sigfillset() at least
   once for each object of type sigset_t to initialize it. If an
   uninitialized or NULL object is passed to sigandset(), the
   results are undefined.

Section Return Value, change

   On success, sigandset() shall return 0. Otherise, sigandset()
   shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

to

   sigandset() returns 0. There are no defined error returns.

Interface sigisemptyset, section Description, add at end:

   Applications shall call sigemptyset() or sigfillset() at least
   once for each object of type sigset_t to initialize it. If an
   uninitialized or NULL object is passed to sigisemptyset(), the
   results are undefined.

Section Return Value, change

      On error, sigisemptyset() shall return -1
   and set errno to indicate the error.

to

      There are no defined error returns.

Section Return Value, change

   On success, sigorset() shall return 0. Otherise, sigorset()
   shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.
