Status: Unapproved

Rationale: the interface basename, documented in ISO POSIX (2003),
does not behave as documented. The implementation contains an
alternative interface, __xpg_basename, which matches the behavior
of the ISO POSIX (2003) specification for basename. As a transitional
fix, __xpg_basename is added and made the default behavior when
an application calls basename; the basename interface is retained
for binary compatibility with older applications.

Add:

   __xpg_basename [LSB]

Change:

   basename [SUSv3]

To:

   basename [LSB]

In 13.4.17. libgen.h

Add:

#define basename __xpg_basename

Delete:

extern char *basename(char *);

Add:

extern char *__xpg_basename(char *);



13.5. Interface Definitions for libc, Table of Contents

Add:

   __xpg_basename -- return the last component of a file name

Add:

   basename -- return the last component of a file name 
          the thread

Add:

__xpg_basename

Name

   __xpg_basename -- return the last component of a file name

Synopsis

   #include <libgen.h>

   char * __xpg_basename(const char * path);

Description

   The __xpg_basename() function shall return a pointer to the
   final component of the pathname named by path, as described in
   ISO POSIX (2003) basename().

   This function is not in the source standard, it is only in the
   binary standard.

Return Value

   See ISO POSIX (2003).


Add:

basename

Name

   basename -- return the last component of a file name

Synopsis

   #include <libgen.h>

   char * basename(const char * path);

Description

   The basename() shall return a pointer to the final component of
   the pathname named by path.

   In the source standard, basename() is implemented as a macro
   causing it to behave as described in ISO POSIX (2003), and is
   equivalent to the function __xpg_basename(). If the macro is
   undefined, basename() from the binary standard is used, with
   differences as described here:

   The string identified by path shall not be modified.

   If path is "/", or ends with a trailing '/' character, the
   basename() function shall return a pointer to an empty string.

Return Value

   On success, the basename() function shall return a pointer to
   the final component of path. Otherwise, it shall return a null
   pointer.
