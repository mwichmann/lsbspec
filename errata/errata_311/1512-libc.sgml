Specification: LSB Core Generic
Specification: LSB Core IA32, IA64, AMD64, PPC32, PPC64, S390, S390X
Edition of Specification: 3.1 
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1512

Rationale: the wchar_t type was incorrectly defined as being of type
"int" in the Generic specification.  In actual implementations, two of
the architectures define this type differently, and LSB must match this.


In LSB Core Generic:

In section 13.4.44. stddef.h,

Remove:

  typedef int wchar_t;


In LSB Core IA32 and PPC32:

In section 11.3.33. stddef.h

Add:

  typedef long int wchar_t;


In LSB Core AMD64, IA64, PPC64, S390, S390X:

In section 11.3.33. stddef.h

Add:

  typedef int wchar_t;
