Specification: LSB Desktop generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1 Update 1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1870

Rationale: error in the G_CCLOSURE_SWAP_DATA macro, the "parameter"
was not used in the RHS.  The version in this specification was
imported from the Gtk project, which had the same problem;
however this error has now been corrected in the Gtk project.


In 15.5.1. glib-2.0/glib-object.h

Change:

#define G_CCLOSURE_SWAP_DATA(cclosure)   \
        (((GClosure*) (closure))->derivative_flag)

To:

#define G_CCLOSURE_SWAP_DATA(cclosure)   \
        (((GClosure*) (closure))->derivative_flag)
