Rationale: the System Initialization chapter, the wording on Cron Jobs
implies that the location of crontab files is specified by ISO POSIX.
In fact, this location is not specified by ISO POSIX, but by FHS.
The section also omits mention that the crontab command may be
used to modify certain files that may not be modified directly.


In Chapter 20. System Initialization,

In section 20.1. Cron Jobs,

Replace:

   In addition to the individual user crontab files specified by
   ISO POSIX (2003) stored under /var/spool/cron, the process
   that executes scheduled commands shall also process the
   following additional crontab files: /etc/crontab,
   /etc/cron.d/*. The installation of a package shall not modify
   the configuration file /etc/crontab.

With:

   In addition to the individual user crontab files specified by
   ISO POSIX (2003), which are located in /var/spool/cron as
   specified by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), the
   process that executes scheduled commands shall also process
   the following additional crontab files, which are in a
   different format (see below). /etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/*. The
   installation of a package shall not modify the crontab file
   /etc/crontab, and shall not directly modify the user crontab
   files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs. but may use the crontab
   command to modify the latter.
