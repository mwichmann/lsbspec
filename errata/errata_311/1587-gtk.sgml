Specification: LSB Desktop generic
Edition of Specification: 3.1 Update 1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1587

Rationale: gtk_button_set_image and gtk_button_get_image are absent
in the referenced specification Gtk 2.6.2 Reference Manual, and
thus undocumented in this specification.   Documentation for these
functions appears in later editions of the referenced specification,
so the omission was apparently unintentional.

In LSB Desktop generic,

Following:

   The behavior of the interfaces in this library is specified by
   the following specifications:

   [Gtk] Gtk 2.6.2 Reference Manual

Add:
