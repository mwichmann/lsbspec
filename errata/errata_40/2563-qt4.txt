Specification: LSB Desktop generic
Edition of Specification: 4.0
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2563

Rationale: QPixmapCache::cacheLimit description of the default value
in the referenced documentation did not match all implementations.
It is changed here to indicate unspecified.

This change should be applied together with 2562-qt4

In LSB Desktop generic:

In Table of Contents:

after 17.5. Data Definitions for libQtGui (17.6 after 2562-qt4 applied)

add
              17.7. Interface Definitions for libQtGui

sections 17.6-17.15 in original, 17.7-17.16 after erratum 2562-qt4 applied,
are renumbered to 17.8-17.17


In XII. Qt Libraries

   Table of Contents
   17. Libraries

Before  17.6. Interfaces for libQtXml (renumbered to 17.8)

Insert:

        17.7. Interface Definitions for libQtGui

              QPixmapCache::cacheLimit -- UUID greater-than
                      comparison operator


sections 17.6-17.15 in original, 17.7-17.16 after erratum 2562-qt4 applied,
