Specification: LSB Desktop generic
Edition of Specification: 4.0
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3902

Rationale: In the erratum corresponding to bug reference
http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2790, data definitions listed
under jerror.h, which had been omitted from LSB 4.0, were added.
However, one item in these data definitions was erroneously included.
In implementations of libjpeg, macro JMESSAGE is defined, some other
items are defined, then JMESSAGE is undefined. The effect is after the
compiler preprocessor completes processing jerror.h, JMESSAGE is not
defined. In the description added in the prior erratum, JMESSAGE is
defined, which is incorrect. Since JMESSAGE is not needed within the
data definitions for libjpeg, it is dropped entirely.


In LSB Desktop generic:

In 9.2. Data Definitions for libjpeg
9.2.1. jerror.h  (added by erratum)

Delete:

#define JERROR_H
