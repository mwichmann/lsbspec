Specification: LSB Desktop generic
Edition of Specification: 4.0
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2847

Rationale: the specification for libpng included some architecture-
specific elements which have been removed in later implementations,
and should not have been exposed as public in any case.

In LSB Desktop generic:

In 8.2. Data Definitions for libpng12

In 8.2.1. png.h

Remove:

#define PNG_ASSEMBLER_CODE_SUPPORTED


In the png_struct definition in the same section,

Remove:

    png_byte mmx_bitdepth_threshold;
    png_uint_32 mmx_rowbytes_threshold;
    png_uint_32 asm_flags;
