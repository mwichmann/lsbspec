Specification: LSB Core generic + 1739-elf
Edition of Specification: 4.0
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2856

Rationale: some of the dynamic section tags specified in the normative
reference "ABI Update" as generic have been incorrectly listed in
this specification as being Linux-specific.  Some additional tags were
omitted entirely.  The error was in this specification's classification
of these tags, by the inclusion rules they have properly been part of
this specification since the normative reference was added.  This change
brings this document into line with the referenced specification.

Assumes the application of erratm 1739-elf, which introduces the header
elf.h which is modified here.


In LSB Core generic:

In 11.3.2.1. ELF Dynamic Entries
