Insert

17.4. Interface Definitions for libQtCore

   Table of Contents
   QUuid::operator > -- UUID greater-than comparison operator
   QUuid::operator < -- UUID less-than comparison operator

   The interfaces defined on the following pages are included in
   libQtCore and are defined by this specification. Unless
   otherwise noted, these interfaces shall be included in the
   source standard.

   Other interfaces listed in Section 17.2 shall behave as
   described in the referenced base document.

   other QUuid and is lexicographically after the other QUuid. If
   the other QUuid has a different variant field, the return value
   is unspecified.


QUuid::operator <

Name

   QUuid::operator < -- UUID less-than comparison operator
