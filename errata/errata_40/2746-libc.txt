Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2746

Rationale: the setsockopt() function is incorrectly described as handling
an ip_mreq structure for IP_MULTICAST_IF, this does not work in any
current implementations.


In LSB Core generic

In 13.5. Interface Definitions for libc

Entry setsockopt, section IP Protocol Level Options

Change:

   IP_MULTICAST_IF

   Set the local device for a multicast socket. optval shall point
   to a ip_mreq structure initialized in the same manner as with
   IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP.

To:

   IP_MULTICAST_IF

   Set the local device for a multicast socket. optval shall point
   to either an ip_mreqn structure or an in_addr structure. If
   using the ip_mreqn structure, the imr_multiaddr field should be
   set to multicast group address, the imr_address field to the
   address of the local interface, and the imr_index field to the
   interface index. If using the in_addr structure, the address of
   the local interface shall be specified. If in_addr or
   imr_address is set to INADDR_ANY, then an appropriate interface
   is chosen by the system. If imr_index is zero, then an
   appropriate interface index is chosen by the implementation.
