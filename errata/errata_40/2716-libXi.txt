Specification: LSB Desktop generic
Edition of Specification: 4.0
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2716

Rationale: the function XInput_find_display was included in error in
this specification for libXi.  It was intended to be internal only.
Normally removing an interface would be subject to a deprecation period,
but in fact certain existing implementations do not have this interface
and cannot provide it. There are no known application uses at this time.


In LSB Desktop generic:

In 6.15.1. XInput

In 6.15.1.1. Interfaces for XInput

   Table 6-20. libXi - XInput Function Interfaces

Remove:

   XInput_find_display [XINPUT]
