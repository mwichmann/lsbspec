Specification: LSB Desktop generic
Edition of Specification: 4.0
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3902

Rationale: In implementations of libjpeg, macro JMESSAGE is defined,
some other items are defined, then JMESSAGE is undefined. The effect is
after the compiler preprocessor completes processing jerror.h, JMESSAGE
is not defined. In the defintions in this specification, JMESSAGE is
left defined, which is incorrect. Since JMESSAGE is not needed within
the data definitions for libjpeg, it is dropped entirely.


In LSB Desktop generic:

In 10.2. Data Definitions for libjpeg
10.2.1. jerror.h

Delete:

#define JERROR_H
