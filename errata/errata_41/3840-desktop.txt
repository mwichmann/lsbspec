Specification: LSB Desktop generic
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3840

Rationale: two structure members are incorrectly declared as
pointers rather than pointer-to-array.


In LSB Desktop generic:

In 9.2. Data Definitions for libjpeg
9.2.2. jpeglib.h

In struct jpeg_decompress_struct

Change:

    int *coef_bits;

To:

    int *(coef_bits)[64];



In 16.28. Data Definitions for libgtk-x11-2.0
16.28.1. gtk-2.0/gtk/gtk.h

In typedef struct _GtkCurve,

Change:

    gfloat *ctlpoint;

To:

    gfloat *(ctlpoint)[2];
