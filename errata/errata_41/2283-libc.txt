Specification: LSB Core generic
Specification: LSB Core IA32 IA64 PPC32 PPC64 S390 S390X AMD64
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Typo
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2283

Rationale: two commonly used constants for use with fnmatch() have
been omitted from this specification.  FNM_CASEFOLD and FNM_FILE_NAME
are added to address the omission; as a side effect the governing
definition of fnmatch() switches from POSIX to LSB.


In LSB Core generic:

In III. Base Libraries,
Table of Contents,
12.5. Interface Definitions for libc

Add:

              fnmatch -- match a filename or a pathname



In: Table 12-34. libc - Standard Library Function Interfaces

Change:

   fnmatch [SUSv3]

To:

   fnmatch [LSB]



In 12.4. Data Definitions for libc,
In 12.4.13. fnmatch.h

Add:

#define FNM_CASEFOLD    (1<<4)
#define FNM_FILE_NAME   FNM_PATHNAME


In 12.5. Interface Definitions for libc,
In Table of Contents

Add:

   fnmatch -- match a filename or a pathname

And in body 

Add:

fnmatch

Name

   fnmatch -- match a filename or a pathname

Description

   fnmatch() is as specified in POSIX 1003.1-2008 (ISO/IEC
   9945-2009), but with differences as listed below.

Additional flags

   In addition to the available values that can be used to form
   flags, as documented in POSIX 1003.1-2008 (ISO/IEC 9945-2009),
   this specification permits the following constants.

   FNM_CASEFOLD

   If this flag is set, the pattern is matched case-insensitively.
   FNM_FILE_NAME

   A synonym for FNM_PATHNAME constant specified in POSIX
   1003.1-2008 (ISO/IEC 9945-2009).
