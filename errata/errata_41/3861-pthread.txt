Specification: LSB Core generic
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3861

Rationale: two of the values available to pass to the function
pthread_rwlockattr_setkind_np() were documented in the Interface
Definition for the function, but none were included in the Data
Definitions.  The default value had an incorrect define left
over from previous editions of this specification (should have
been withdrawn at LSB 4.0).


In LSB Core generic:

In 12.10. Data Definitions for libpthread
12.10.1. pthread.h

Remove:

#define PTHREAD_RWLOCK_DEFAULT_NP       2


Add:

enum {
    PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_READER_NP,
    PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_WRITER_NP,
    PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_WRITER_NONRECURSIVE_NP,
    PTHREAD_RWLOCK_DEFAULT_NP = PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_READER_NP
};


XXX Need to still include documentation
