Specification: LSB Desktop generic
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3882

Rationale: The gfloat type was declared in the incorrect header.
It was described in glib-2.0/glib-object.h which is associated with
the libgobject-2.0 library, while it was intended to be described in
glib-2.0/glib.h, associated with the libglib-2.0 library.

In LSB Desktop generic:

In 16.3. Data Definitions for libglib-2.0
16.3.1. glib-2.0/glib.h

Add: 

typedef float gfloat;


In 16.6. Data Definitions for libgobject-2.0
16.6.1. glib-2.0/glib-object.h

Remove:

typedef float gfloat;
