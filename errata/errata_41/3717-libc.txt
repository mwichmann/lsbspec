Specification: LSB Core generic
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3717

Rationale: several items in Data Definitions are defined in places other
than described by POSIX 2003 and other specifications. In practical
use, this caused some issues with portable software which could be
compiled in other environments but not when attempting conformance
with this specification.  The changes to constants SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR,
SEEK_END and function select() are intended to align with POSIX 2003,
and the change to type off64_t is intended to align with LFS (and
consistency with POSIX as to where related type off_t is defined).

In LSB Core generic:

In 12.4. Data Definitions for libc
12.4.11. fcntl.h

Add:
#ifndef SEEK_SET
#define SEEK_SET        0

#ifndef SEEK_CUR
#define SEEK_CUR        1

#ifndef SEEK_END
#define SEEK_END        2


12.4.73. sys/select.h

Add:

extern int select(int __nfds, fd_set * __readfds, fd_set * __writefds,
                  fd_set * __exceptfds, struct timeval *__timeout);


12.4.85. sys/types.h

Add:

typedef long long int off64_t;


12.4.96. unistd.h

Delete:

#ifndef SEEK_SET
#define SEEK_SET        0

#ifndef SEEK_CUR
#define SEEK_CUR        1

#ifndef SEEK_END
#define SEEK_END        2

Delete:

typedef long long int off64_t;

Delete:

extern int select(int __nfds, fd_set * __readfds, fd_set * __writefds,
                  fd_set * __exceptfds, struct timeval *__timeout);
