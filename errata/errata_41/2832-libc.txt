Specification: LSB Core generic
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2832

Rationale: the macro offsetof, required by ISO C, fails when applied
in certain circumstances.  The circumstances are particular to certain
compilation environments, but to facilitate application development on
a range of platforms, the following adjustment is made to accomodate
implementations.  The __builtin_offsetof compiler builtin in the special
case meets the requirement of POSIX 2003, which is a restatement of the
ISO C requirement:

  offsetof(type, member-designator)

      Integer constant expression of type size_t, the value of which is
      the offset in bytes to the structure member (member-designator),
      from the beginning of its structure (type).


In LSB Core generic:

In 12.4. Data Definitions for libc
12.4.56. stddef.h

Change:

#define offsetof(TYPE,MEMBER)   ((size_t)&((TYPE*)0)->MEMBER)

To:

#if !defined(__GNUC__)
#define __builtin_offsetof (TYPE, MEMBER)       ((size_t)&((TYPE*)0)->MEMBER)
#endif
#define offsetof(TYPE,MEMBER)   __builtin_offsetof (TYPE, MEMBER)
