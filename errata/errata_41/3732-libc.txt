Specification: LSB Core generic
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3732

Rationale: the function rename() is defined by ISO POSIX 2001
as having a prototype in <stdio.h>, but was described by this
specification in a different header. For better alignment,
move the prototype.


In LSB Core generic:

In 12.4. Data Definitions for libc

12.4.58. stdio.h

Add:

extern int rename(const char *__old, const char *__new);


12.4.96. unistd.h

Remove:

extern int rename(const char *__old, const char *__new);
