Specification: LSB Core generic
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3718

Rationale: As specified in ISO POSIX 2003, the sigevent structure shall
contain at least certain members, including the notification callback
function sigev_not.  In implementations described by this specification
sigev_notify_function and an additional member sigev_notify_attributes
are defined by macro, but the macros were omitted from this specification.
Portable application code which referenced sigev_notify_function could
thus not be compiled.

In LSB Core generic:

In 12.4. Data Definitions for libc
12.4.54. signal.h

Add:

#define sigev_notify_attributes _sigev_un._sigev_thread._attribute
#define sigev_notify_function   _sigev_un._sigev_thread._function
