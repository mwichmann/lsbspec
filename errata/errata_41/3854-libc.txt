Specification: LSB Core generic
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3854

Rationale: six functions are incorrectly documented as needing to include
<libc.h>; the header is not specified. The functions __chk_fail and
__stack_chk_fail should be documented as appearing only in the source
standard, and should have no header refrence.  The functions __fprintf_chk
and __vfprintf_chk should be documented as requiring <stdio.h> and the
function __stpncpy_chk should be documented as requiring <string.h>.
These three prototypes did not appear in Data Definitions, and should
be added.  One additional function, lcong48_r, should be documented as
requiring <stdlib.h>.


In LSB Core generic:

In 12.4. Data Definitions for libc
12.4.58. stdio.h

Add:

extern int __fprintf_chk(FILE *, int, const char *, ...);
extern int __vfprintf_chk(FILE *, int, const char *, va_list);


12.4.60. string.h

Add:

extern char *__stpncpy_chk(char *, const char *, size_t, size_t);


In 12.5. Interface Definitions for libc


In interface __chk_fail, section Synopsis:

Delete:

   #include <libc.h>

in section Description:

Add:

   The __chk_fail() function is not in the source standard; it is
   only in the binary standard.


In interface __fprintf_chk, section Synopsis:

Change:

   #include <libc.h>

To:

   #include <stdio.h>



In interface __chk_fail, section Synopsis:

Delete:

   #include <libc.h>


in section Description:

Add:

   The __stack_chk_fail() function is not in the source standard;
   it is only in the binary standard.



In interface __stpncpy_chk, section Synopsis:

Change:

   #include <libc.h>

To:

   #include <string.h>


In interface __vfprintf_chk, section Synopsis:

Change:

   #include <libc.h>

To:

   #include <stdio.h>



In interface lcong48_r, section Synopsis:

Change:

   #include <libc.h>

To:

   #include <stdlib.h>
