Specification: LSB Core generic
Specification: LSB Core IA32 IA64 PPC32 PPC64 S390 S390X AMD64
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3251

Rationale: the getlimit() and setrlimit() functions have additional
behaviors beyond that specified in POSIX 1003.1-2001. Additional resource
limits and error conditions are defined, but were not described in this
specification.

Synopsis

   #include <sys/resource.h>

   int getrlimit(__rlimit_resource_t __resource, struct rlimit *
   __rlimits);

   int setrlimit(__rlimit_resource_t __resource, const struct
   rlimit * __rlimits);

Description

   getrlimit() and setrlimit() are as specified in POSIX
   1003.1-2008 (ISO/IEC 9945-2009), but with differences as listed
   below.

Extra Resources

   These additional resources extend the list in POSIX 1003.1-2008
   (ISO/IEC 9945-2009).

   - RLIMIT_NPROC

   The maximum number of processes (or, more precisely on Linux,
   threads) that can be created for the real user ID of the
   calling process. Upon encountering this limit, fork() shall
   fail with the error EAGAIN.
   - RLIMIT_MEMLOCK

   The maximum number of bytes of memory that may be locked into
   RAM. In effect this limit is rounded down to the nearest
   multiple of the system page size. This limit affects mlock()
   and mlockall(), the mmap() MAP_LOCKED operation and the
   shmctl() SHM_LOCK operation. The shmctl() SHM_LOCK locks are
   accounted for separately from the per-process memory locks
   established by mlock(), mlockall(), and mmap() MAP_LOCKED. In
   the former case, the limit sets a maximum on the total bytes in
   shared memory segments (see shmget()) that may be locked by the
   real user ID of the calling process. A process can lock bytes
   up to this limit in each of these two categories.
   - RLIMIT_LOCKS

   A limit on the combined number of flock() locks and fcntl()
   leases that this process may establish. This limit is obsolete
   and should not be used; support depends heavily on the version
   of the operating system kernel.
   - RLIMIT_RSS

   Specifies the limit (in pages) of the process's resident set.
   This limit is obsolete and should not be used; support depends
   heavily on the version of the operating system kernel. It
   affects only calls to madvise() specifying MADV_WILLNEED.

Extra Errors

   These additional error codes extend the list in POSIX
   1003.1-2008 (ISO/IEC 9945-2009).

   - EFAULT

   A pointer argument points to a location outside the accessible
   address space.
