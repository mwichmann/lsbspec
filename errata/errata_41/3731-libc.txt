Specification: LSB Core generic
Edition of Specification: 4.1
Type: Error
Status: Unapproved
Bug reference: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3731

Rationale: the function mkstemp() is defined by ISO POSIX 2001
as having a prototype in <stdlib.h>, but was described by this
specification in a different header. For better alignment,
move the prototype.


In LSB Core generic:

In 12.4. Data Definitions for libc

12.4.59. stdlib.h

Add:

extern int mkstemp(char *__template);


12.4.96. unistd.h

Delete:

extern int mkstemp(char *__template);
