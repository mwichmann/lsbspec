libpng15 is an evolution of libpng12

TODO: at the moment, only the common interfaces are documented -
and those by way of copying the entries from libpng(12).
These should be examined, and the others - currently the count
stands at 103 - documented.

HOWEVER - there is still a question about the two png libs.
Some distributions have one, some the other, few have both!
