TITLE

LSB Packaging Dependencies

GOAL / ABSTRACT

Rationale(s):

- Packaged software in vendor distributions uses dependency chains in order
  to insure that packages are installed correctly. Increasingly, however,
  differences between vendor dependencies are causing installation failures
  for users who "expect" to be able mix `n match packages from different
  vendors without trouble.

- Packagers of software need predictable environments in order to package
  software reliably. Packagers "expect" to be able to create a single package
  that can be installed on "standard" systems flawlessly. At the moment, since
  every distro has slightly different dependencies that are changing with
  every release, packagers often have to prepare and test packages for
  each vendor release.

- Discovery of other packages that are necessary to satisfy dependencies from
  a given package can lead to problems. At least part of the problem is that
  there is no common format for supplying information about the dependencies
  provided by a given distribution.

Proposed deliverables:

1) Choose a "standard" common format for vendors to supply dependencies provided
   by each distribution release. Please note that multiple "standard" formats
   will almost certainly be needed at the moment. I also suggest that CD`s are
   not an adequate "standard" common format, I`m looking for an explicit
   encapsulation of package metadata separate from the distribution itself.

2) Collect current and historical information from existing Linux distro`s.
   I suggest collecting metadata from each distro in a "standard" form for
   use by tools here, nothing more.
              
3) Publishing (or otherwise making available) in "standard" common format
   dependency data so that tools like apt and rpmfind can begin work on
   more efficient package discovery mechanisms.

4) Develop tools/techniques that vendors can use to generate the "standard"
   common format for new releases. For example, the following two rpm commands
   can be use to capture all metadata from the set of packages that compose a
   vendor release:
            
   rpm --dbpath <path_to_temporary_database> --initdb
   rpm --dbpath <path_to_temporary_database> -U 
       --nodeps --noscripts --notriggers --justdb <packages>+

   with output in <path_to_temporary_database>. (Note: Only the Packages file
   is essential, the inverted lists can be regenerated with a --rebuilddb.)

   Note: I`m confident that equally efficient "standard" common formats exist,
   and will be proposed, for apt, rpmfind, whatever.

5) Assist with documentation about "standard" common format(s) suffciently
   to encourage vendors to provide this information as part of their
   distribution(s) in the future.
