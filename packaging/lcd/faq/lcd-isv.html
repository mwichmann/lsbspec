>What is an ISV?</A
></H2
><P
>An Independent Software Vendor.  An ISV is any
	organization that has a software packages to install, but
	(probably) does not control an installation environment
	(e.g. Linux distribution) itself.</P

>As an ISV do I have to supply my application in
      RPM format to be LSB compliant?</A
></H2
><P
>No. ISV's are not obligated to ship their software in
	the RPM format.  They can use any other format, or even write
	their own custom installer. However using the LSB recommended
	format will probably make life easier for themselves and their
	users.</P
><P
>Please note that just having LCD compliant packages will
	not automatically assure that the packaged software will
	install properly or work as required on all systems with
	implementations of the LCD packaging system.  One,
	implementations of the LSB spec and the LCD packaging system
	will vary somewhat in areas outside the standards that may be
	important to your software. Two, errors do happen and the
	faster they are discovered the cheaper it is to fix them.
	Quality assurance checks should still be performed for each
	release that you wish to claim compatibility with.</P
><P
>That said, conformance with the LSB standard and using
	the LCD packaging system will save effort and time.  The LSB
	limits the range of systems to develop for and the LCD
	packaging system reduces the installation complexity and
	duplication to the lowest common denominator by design.</P
