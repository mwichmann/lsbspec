>I like to use packager &lt;foo&gt; instead of
RPM!</A
></H2
><P
>The LSB does not specify the program `rpm' nor the
RPM database, but
instead the RPM file format. How the LSB compliant packages are
processed by the distributions during installation is up to
them. Using conversion programs such as alien it is possible to
convert the format to .tgz or .deb files and use other package
management programs other than rpm. </P
><P
>This arrangement was agreed up on
by the major distributions including deb based ones (eg Debian, Storm,
Corel) as well as RPM based ones (Red Hat, SuSE, TurboLinux, Caldera,
Mandrake).</P

>But some features of the RPM format can't be done by format &lt;X&gt;!</A
></H2
><P
>For compatibility reasons with Debian dpkg systems using alien, we
will also sharply restrict what kind of features can be
included in LSB binary packages.  For example: trigger scripts and
relocatable file-system payloads are not going to be allowed in LSB
binary package.</P
><P
>One of the tasks of this task-force is to build an
official LCD package verifier to check all statically verifiable
packaging rules for certification purposes.  Currently it looks like an extension of
Rpmlint will do the job.</P

>What about this new RPM/deb merged packaging format I've heard about?</A
></H2
><P
>The use of the RPM format is intended to be an interim measure. The
work on this new format has not been completed yet. It will probably
be adopted by the LSB in the future when it is ready.</P

this task.  Its email list is at <A

>I don't like RPMs because I've tried using an RPM for distribution &lt;a&gt; and it didn't work on distribution &lt;b&gt;</A
></H2
><P
>This is a problem associated with the release
structure and context that a package was created for
and not the actual packaging format. These problems are due to
differences between different distributions such as directory layout
and ABI differences between versions of libraries installed. </P
><P
>Parts of
the LSB specification such as the File Hierarchy Standard (FHS) and
the specification of various ABIs attempt to remove these problems.
One of the LCD work-products is a set of release specific meta packages
that document and enforce the sets of native packages that best
implement the current LSB Standard. </P
><P
>  These packages are intended as a best effort attempt to
make the dependency systems work for us in the short term.  Later
iterations will refine both the LSB compliance of the individual
distributions and the sophistication of the dependency network.</P

>Why aren't categories of packages (such as
System, Development, Networking) defined in the LSB</A
></H2
><P
>This is considered outside the scope of the LSB. It
does not affect the ability 
for packages to install and run on different distributions. </P
><P
>However, more sophisticated dependency networks between LSB
packages may turn out to be necessary to describe optional portions of
the LSB specification.  This does not seem to be necessary yet so we
will duck the problem for as long as is possible.</P

>What dependencies can be specified in an LSB compliant package?</A
></H2
><P
>The package should only be dependent on the base LSB system (eg
LSB-2.0) being present and other LSB packages. </P
><P
> In the short term we
expect that only packages from the same or co-operating ISVs will have
inter-dependencies because no official forum exists for standardizing
such dependencies.  We expect that when there is enough experience around to
determine a need then standards will appear.</P
