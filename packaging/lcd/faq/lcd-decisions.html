>Because this task-force is focused on building working
      implementations quickly many of the decisions on what to make
      part of the "standard" are being made purely on pragmatic
      considerations.  If an aspect of what would be needed as part of
      the system already has a working implementation that is widely
      available, it may just become part of the "standard" as it is to
      speed the building of reference implementations. </P

>Pragmatism.  The RPM binary
	  package file format is a proven, robust, backward and
	  forward compatible format.  It's currently used by many
	  distributions and is understood boy others.</P
