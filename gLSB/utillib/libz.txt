The reference to the zlib 1.1.3 manual, of course, is to
the specification found in the manual, not to the implementation.  The
zlib 1.1.4 manual, for example, is identical (except for the version
number, which we do not specify).  The only reason not to just say
"zlib 1.1.x" is that it is hard to know whether a hypothetical future
release would be compatible.
