<TITLE>Description
</TITLE>
<PARA>
To deliver electronic mail (email), applications shall support
the interface provided by /usr/sbin/sendmail (described here).
This interface shall be the default delivery method for applications.
</PARA>
<PARA>
This program sends an email message to one or more recipients,
routing the message as necessary.  This program is not intended
as a user interface routine.
</PARA>
<PARA>
With no flags, <COMMAND>sendmail</COMMAND> reads its standard input up to an
end-of-file or a line consisting only of a single dot and sends a
copy of the message found there to all of the addresses listed.
It determines the network(s) to use based on the syntax and
contents of the addresses.
</PARA>
<PARA>
It is recommended that applications use as few flags as
necessary, none if possible.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Some agents allow aliasing on the local system to be prevented
by preceding the address with a backslash.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The format of messages must be as defined in RFC 2822.
</PARA>

<title>Options</title>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>-bm</term>
<listitem>
<para>
reads mail from standard input and delivers to the recipient addresses.
This is the default mode of operation.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-bp</term>
<listitem>
<para>
lists information about messages currently in the input mail queue.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-bs</term>
<listitem>
<para>
uses the SMTP protocol as described in RFC 2821; reads SMTP commands on
standard input and writes SMTP responses on standard output.
</para>
<para>
Note that RFC 2821 specifies \r\n (CR-LF) be used at the end of each
line, but Unix pipes almost always use \n (LF) instead.  To deal with
this, agents will accept both \r\n and \n at the end of each line.
When accepting \r\n, the \r before the \n is silently discarded.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-F fullname</term>
<listitem>
<para>
explicitly sets the full name of the sender for incoming
mail unless the message already contains a From: message
header.
</para>
<para>
If the user running <COMMAND>sendmail</COMMAND> is not sufficiently trusted,
then the actual sender may be indicated in the message,
depending on the behavior of the agent.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-f name</term>
<listitem>
<para>
explicitly sets the envelope sender address for incoming
mail.   If there is no From: header, the address specified
in the From: header will also be set.
</para>
<para>
If the user running <COMMAND>sendmail</COMMAND> is not sufficiently trusted,
then the actual sender will be indicated in the message.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-i</term>
<listitem>
<para>
ignores dots alone on lines by themselves in incoming
messages.  This option is ignored when -bs is used.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-odb</term>
<listitem>
<para>
delivers any mail in background, if supported; otherwise ignored.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
delivers any mail in foreground, if supported; otherwise ignored.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-oem or -em</term>
<listitem>
<para>
mails errors back to the sender. (default)
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-oep or -ep</term>
<listitem>
<para>
writes errors to the standard error output.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-oeq or -eq</term>
<listitem>
<para>
does not send notification of errors to the sender.  This
only works for mail delivered locally.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-oew or -ew</term>
<listitem>
<para>
writes errors to the sender's terminal using the write(1)
command, if he is logged in.  Otherwise, mails errors back
to the sender.  If not supported, reports errors in the
same manner as -oem.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-oi</term>
<listitem>
<para>
is equivalent to -i.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-om</term>
<listitem>
<para>
indicates that the sender of
a message should receive a copy of the message if the
sender appears in an alias expansion.  Ignored if aliases
are not supported.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-t</term>
<listitem>
<para>
reads the message to obtain recipients from the To:, Cc:,
and Bcc: headers in the message instead of from the
command arguments.  If a Bcc: header is present, it is
removed from the message unless there is no To: or Cc:
header, in which case a Bcc: header with no data is
created, in accordance with RFC 2822.
</para>
<para>
If there are any arguments, they specify addresses to
which the message is not to be delivered.  That is, the
argument addresses are removed from the recipients list
obtained from the headers.  Note: some agents implement
this behavior in reverse, adding addresses instead of
removing them.  Others may disallow addresses in
argument list.  Therefore, applications should not put
addresses in the argument list if -t is used.
</para>
<para>
This option is sometimes ignored when not in -bm mode
(the default).
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>-v</term>
<listitem>
<para>
is more verbose.  Additional -v options may make the
software increasingly verbose.

indicate successful delivery.

<TITLE>Notes/Rationale
</TITLE>
<para>
This page is believed to reflect functionality provided by smail, exim
and other implementations, just not the <COMMAND>sendmail</COMMAND> 
implementation.
</para>
<para>
There has been a suggestion to remove -oew, -ew, -om, -t, and -v.
Also to disallow -i when -bs is specified.  Most of this strikes me as
a good idea, but it might want further discussion.  Seems to me that
the text "Some agents allow aliasing on the local system to be
prevented by preceding the address with a backslash" needs to remain,
if the behavior of different implementations really does vary.
