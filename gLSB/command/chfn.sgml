<TITLE>Description</TITLE>
<PARA>
chfn changes user fullname, office number, office extension, and home
phone number information for a user's account.  This information is
typically printed by finger and similar programs.  A normal user may
only change the fields for their own account, the super user may
change the fields for any account.  Also, only the super user may use
the -o option to change the undefined portions of the GCOS field.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The only restrictions placed on the contents of the fields is that no
control characters may be present, nor any of comma, colon, or equal
sign.  The other field does not have this restriction, and is used to
store accounting information used by other applications.
</PARA>

<PARA>
If none of the options are selected, chfn operates in an interactive
fashion, prompting the user with the current values for all of the
fields.  Enter the new value to change the field, or leave the line
blank to use the current value.  The current value is displayed
between a pair of [ ] marks.  Without options, chfn prompts for the
current user account.
</PARA>

<PARA>
As it is possible for the system to be configured to restrict which
fields a non-privileged user is permitted to change, applications
should be written to gracefully handle these situations.
