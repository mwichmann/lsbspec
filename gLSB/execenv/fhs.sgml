The FHS allows many components or subsystems to be optional. An application
must check for the existence of an optional component before using it, and
should behave in a reasonable manner if the optional component is not
present.
</PARA>
<para>
The FHS requirement to locate the operating system kernel in either
<filename>/</filename> or <filename>/boot</filename> does not apply if
the operating system kernel does not exist as a file in the filesystem.
