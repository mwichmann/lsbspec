<TITLE>Script Names</TITLE>

<PARA>
Since the init.d scripts shall live in a single directory, they shall 
come from a single namespace.  Three means of assigning names from
this namespace are available:
</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST MARK="bullet">
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Assigned namespace.  This namespace consists of names which
only use the character set [a-z0-9].  This space is
desirable for scripts which system administrators may
often wish to run manually: e.g., "/etc/init.d/named restart"
In order to avoid conflicts these init.d names shall be reserved
through the Linux Assigned Names and Numbers Authority (LANANA).  
Information about the LANANA may be found at
<ULINK URL="http://www.lanana.org">www.lanana.org</ULINK>.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Commonly used names shall be reserved in advance; 
developers for projects should be encouraged to reserve names
from LANANA, so that each distribution can use the same
name, and to avoid conflicts with other projects.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
Hierarchical namespace.  This namespace consists of scripts
names which look like this: [hier1]-[hier2]-...-[name],
where name is again taken the character set [a-z0-9], 
and where there may be one or more [hier-n] components.  
[hier1] may either be an LSB provider name assigned
by the LANANA, or it may be owners' DNS name in lower case, with at
least one '.' (e.g., "debian.org", "staroffice.sun.com").
The LSB provider name assigned by LANANA 
shall only consist of the ASCII characters [a-z0-9].
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
Reserved namespace.  This namespace consists of script names
which begin with the character '_', and is reserved for
distribution use only.  This namespace should be used
for core packages only, and in general use of this
namespace is highly discouraged.  

</PARA></LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>


<PARA>
In general, if a package or some system function is likely to be used
on multiple systems, the package developers or the distribution SHOULD
get a registered name through LANANA, and distributions should strive to
use the same name whenever possible.  For applications which may not
be "core" or may not be commonly installed, the hierarchical namespace
may be more appropriate.  An advantage to the hierarchical namespace
is that there is no need to consult with the LANANA before obtaining an
assigned name.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Short names are highly desirable, since many system
administrators like to use them to manually start and stop services.
Given this, they should be standardized on a per-package basis.  This
is the rationale behind having a LANANA organization to assign these
names.  The LANANA may be called upon to handle other namespace issues,
such as package/prerequisites naming (which is essential to making 
prerequisites to work correctly).
