<TITLE>Installation and removal of init.d files</TITLE>

<PARA>
An init.d file is installed by copying it into /etc/init.d (which may
be a symlink to another location).  This can be done by the package
installer.  During the package's postinstall script, the program
"/usr/lib/lsb/install_initd" to configure the distribution's boot
script system to call the package's init.d file at the appropriate
time.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The install_initd program takes a single argument, the pathanme to the
/etc/init.d file.  For example:
</PARA>

<SCREEN>
	/usr/lib/lsb/install_initd /etc/init.d/inet
</SCREEN>


<PARA> 
When a software package is removed, the package's preuninstall script
shall call /usr/lib/lsb/remove_initd and pass the pathname to the
/etc/init.d file.  The package manager is still responsible for removing 
the /etc/init.d file; the remove_initd program is provided in case the
distribution needs to clean up any other modifications the distribution's
boot script system which might have been made by the install_initd program.
For example:
</PARA>

<SCREEN>
	/usr/lib/lsb/remove_initd /etc/init.d/inet
</SCREEN>


<PARA>
There should be a tool available to the user (ala RedHat's chkconfig)
which can be used by the system administrator to easily manipulate at
which init levels a particular init.d script is started or stopped.
This specification currently does not specify such an interface,
however.  (XXX should it?)
