<TITLE>Description
</TITLE>
<PARA>
The stpncpy function copies at most n characters from  the
string  pointed  to by src, including the terminating '\0'
character, to the array pointed  to  by  dest.  Exactly  n
characters  are written at dest. If the length strlen(src)
is smaller than n, the remaining characters in  the  array
pointed to by dest are filled with '\0' characters. If the
length strlen(src) is greater or equal to  n,  the  string
pointed to by dest will not be '\0' terminated.

The strings may not overlap.

The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
n characters at dest.

<TITLE>RETURN VALUE

<PARA>
stpncpy returns a pointer to the terminating null in dest,
or, if dest is not null-terminated, dest + n.
