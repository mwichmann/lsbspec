<TITLE>Description
</TITLE>
<PARA>
       The wcpncpy function is the wide-character  equivalent  of
       the  stpncpy function. It copies at most n wide characters
       from the wide-character string pointed to by src,  includ
       ing  the terminating L'\0' character, to the array pointed
       to by dest. Exactly n wide characters are written at dest.
       If the length wcslen(src) is smaller than n, the remaining
       wide characters in the array pointed to by dest are filled
       with  L'\0'  characters.  If  the  length  wcslen(src)  is
       greater or equal to n, the string pointed to by dest  will
       not be L'\0' terminated.

</PARA><PARA>
       The strings may not overlap.

</PARA><PARA>
       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
       n wide characters at dest.
