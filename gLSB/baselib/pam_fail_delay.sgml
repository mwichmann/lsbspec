<TITLE>Description
</TITLE>
<PARA>
<FUNCTION>pam_fail_delay</FUNCTION> specifies the minimum delay for the 
PAM library to use when an authentication error occurs. The actual delay 
will vary by as much at 25%. If this function is called multiple times, 
the longest time specified by any of the call will be used.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The delay is invoked if an authentication error occurs during the
<FUNCTION>pam_authenticate</FUNCTION> or <FUNCTION>pam_chauthtok</FUNCTION>
function calls.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Independent of the success of
<FUNCTION>pam_authenticate</FUNCTION> or <FUNCTION>pam_chauthtok</FUNCTION>,
the delay time is reset to its default value of 0 when the PAM library returns 
control to the application.
