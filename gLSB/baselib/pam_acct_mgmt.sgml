<TITLE>Description
</TITLE>
<PARA>
  This function is typically called after the user has been
  authenticated.  It establishes whether the user's account is healthy.
  That is to say, whether the user's account is still active and whether
  the user is permitted to gain access to the system at this time.
</PARA>
<PARA>
  Valid flags, any one of which, may be logically OR'd with
  <CONSTANT>PAM_SILENT</CONSTANT>, and are the same as those applicable to
  the <PARAMETER>flags</PARAMETER> argument of pam_authenticate(3).
</PARA>

<PARA>
       The user is valid but their authentication token has expired.
        The correct response to this return-value is to require that the
        user satisfies the pam_chauthtok() function before obtaining
        service.  It may not be possible for some applications to do
        this.  In such cases, the user should be denied access until
        such time as they can update their password.
