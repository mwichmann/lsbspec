The documentation in this directory is handled a bit differently from
others; the "authoritative" docs are contained in XML files, named
"api-*.xml", that are generated using the standard documentation tools
for CUPS.  Those use an XML format called "mini-xml"; more information
can be found here:

  http://www.minixml.org/

Copies of these files, as generated from upstream, are stored here.
Those are then translated into DocBook by the "mk-from-mxmldoc"
script, using the "cupsfunc_template.sgml.in" template file.  The
translation is entirely mechanical; no corrections to the information
in the XML files are made.

This leads to an important warning:

              --> DO NOT EDIT THE DOCBOOK API FILES! <--

Instead, you should edit the XML files.  Even better, you should edit
the comments in the CUPS source from which those XML files are
generated, and get them integrated, so the standard docs and
upstream's docs match, but that's sometimes not possible if quick
edits need to be made.

Every so often, we should review edits made to the XML files, and
contribute them upstream to the CUPS project.
