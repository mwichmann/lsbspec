<title>Module Specific Scope</title>
<para>
This is the Imaging module of the Linux Standard Base (LSB).
This module provides the fundamental system interfaces, libraries,
and runtime environment upon which conforming applications and
libraries programming to the LSB Imaging module depend.
</para>

<!-- no arch-specific parts to Imaging, at least for now
<para>
The common part of LSB Imaging should be used in conjunction with an
architecture-specific part. Whenever a section of the common part
is supplemented by architecture-specific information, the common part
includes a reference to the architecture-specific part. 
Architecture-specific parts of LSB Imaging 
may also contain additional information that is not referenced in the
common part.
</para>

<para>
Interfaces described in LSB Imaging are mandatory except 
where explicitly listed otherwise. 
Interfaces described in LSB Imaging presume the existence
of the LSB Core module; there may be other LSB module specifications also.
