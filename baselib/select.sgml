<PARA>
Specified as in the Single Unix Specification.  But note the text "On
successful completion, the object pointed to by the timeout argument
may be modified."
</PARA>

<PARA>
Linux systems currently modify the timeval structure to reflect the
amount of time not slept; most other implementations do not do this.
This causes problems both when Linux code which reads the timeval
structure is ported to other operating systems, and when code is
ported to Linux that reuses the timeval structure for multiple selects
in a loop without reinitializing it.  Consider timeout to be undefined
after select returns and reinitialize it before each call to select.

<PARA>
This behavior may be deprecated in the future.
