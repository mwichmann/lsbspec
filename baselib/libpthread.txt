The semantics of system calls do not follow the pthread behavior. This is
the result of using clone() instead of lightweight processes. A complete list
of differences is not yet available, so applications are discouraged from
using pthreads.

<PARA>
POSIX specifies a concept of per-process rather than per-thread
signals.  The LSB does not require this behavior; traditional Linux
implementations have had per-thread signals only.

<PARA>
POSIX specifies that changing the user or group id instantly affects
the behavior of all threads.  This behavior is not specified;
applications must use their own lock if they need this behavior.
Rationale: it seems unnecessary and it is a performance hit (an SMP
kernel must lock the user id).  (FIXME: is this our current
understanding?  It was discussed on lsb-spec on January 2000 but I'm
not sure we reached a consensus).

<PARA>
Although this standard doesn't have a way to list processes (/proc or
"ps" command line isn't in, right?), it is our intention to not
specify one way or the other whether multiple threads appear as
separate processes or as a single process.
