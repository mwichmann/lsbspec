The semantics of system calls do not follow the pthread behavior. This is
the result of using clone() instead of lightweight processes. A complete list
of differences is not yet available, so applications are discouraged from
using pthreads.

POSIX specifies that changing the user or group id instantly affects
the behavior of all threads.  This behavior is not specified;
applications must use their own lock if they need this behavior.
Rationale: it seems unnecessary and it is a performance hit (an SMP
kernel must lock the user id).  (FIXME: is this our current
understanding?  It was discussed on lsb-spec on January 2000 but I'm
not sure we reached a consensus).
