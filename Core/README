Module directory for LSB-Core
(planned)

LSB-Core consists of multiple constituent submodules, subject to change
over time.  For LSB 5.0:

	Base, Security, ELF, Packaging 

Each of these submodules has a source directory in this project.  When the
unified bookset is built, however, it has to reference some unified items
- introductory and appendix material - which can't easily be reconstitued
from the individual submodule directories.  This directory exists only
to house that material, and does not otherwise contain specification
material.

Note the status of ELF and Packaging is a little odd at the moment -
they are treated like submodules according to the description above,
but as this moment don't have official submodule status - i.e. don't
appear in the specdb as such.  That's proposed to change
