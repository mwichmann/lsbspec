Module directory for LSB-Core
(TODO: check if this has changed)

LSB-Core consists of multiple constituent submodules, subject to change
over time.  For LSB 5.0:

	Base, Security, ELF, Packaging 

Each of these submodules has a source directory in this project.  When the
unified bookset is built, however, it has to reference some unified items
- introductory and appendix material - which can't easily be reconstitued
from the individual submodule directories.  This directory exists only
to house that material, and does not otherwise contain specification
material.

===============
TODO 9 Dec 2012:

intro chapters have been created (by copying the Base (LSB) chapters),
entities added, and build in booksets/LSB-Core* adjusted.   However, the
intro chapters do not yet reflect a "combined" introduction.  ELF has
separate intro chapters - which will be left in place, but only for
the ELF submodule book, not to be used eventually.  C++ was recently
eliminated as a separate submodule, need to check that intro has all
the material it needs from the old cxxinto files.  And any needed intro
material from the security submodule should be integrated as well.

Current Core generic book:

&core-generic-intro;
<PART ID=ELF-GENERIC>
<TITLE>Executable And Linking Format (ELF)</TITLE>
&elf-intro;
&elf-contents;
</PART>
&base-contents;
&security-contents;
&packaging-contents;
&core-generic-appA;
&license;


This should be adjusted (as well as the ELF chapter) so that the eventual
book build looks like:

&core-generic-intro;
&elf-contents;
&base-contents;
&security-contents;
&packaging-contents;
&core-generic-appA;
&license;
