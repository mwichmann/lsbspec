<title>Module Specific Scope</title>
<para>
This is the &specarchitecture; architecture specific
part of the Core module of the Linux Standard Base (LSB).
This part supplements the common part of the LSB Core module
with those interfaces that differ between architectures.
</para>

<para>
This part should be used in conjunction with &ISOSTD-1;, the common part.
Whenever a section of the common part
is supplemented by architecture-specific information, the common part
includes a reference to the architecture-specific part. 
This part may also contain additional information 
that is not referenced in the common part.
</para>

<para>
Interfaces described in this part of &ISOSTD; are mandatory 
except where explicitly listed otherwise.
Core interfaces may be supplemented by other modules;
all other modules are built upon Core.
