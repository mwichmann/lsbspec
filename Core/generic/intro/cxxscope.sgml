This is the C++ module of the Linux Standard Base (LSB).
This module supplements the core interfaces by providing
system interfaces, libraries,
and a runtime environment for applications built using the
C++ programming language. These interfaces provide low-level
support for the core constructs of the language, and
implement the standard base C++ libraries.

<PARA>
Interfaces described in this module are presented in terms
of C++; the binary interfaces will use encoded or mangled
versions of the names.
