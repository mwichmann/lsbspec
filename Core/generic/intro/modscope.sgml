<title>Module Specific Scope</title>
<para>
This is the common part of the Core module of the Linux Standard Base (LSB),
&ISOSTD-1;.
This module provides the fundamental system interfaces, libraries,
and runtime environment upon which all conforming applications and
libraries depend.
</para>

<para>
&ISOSTD-1;, the common part, should be used in conjunction with an
architecture-specific part. Whenever a section of the common part
is supplemented by architecture-specific information, the common part
includes a reference to the architecture-specific part. 
Architecture-specific parts of &ISOSTD;
may also contain additional information that is not referenced in the
common part.
</para>

<para>
Interfaces described in this part of &ISOSTD; are mandatory except where explicitly
listed otherwise. Core interfaces may be supplemented by other modules;
all other modules are built upon Core.
