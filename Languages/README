This is a dummy module specification.

LSB-Languages consists of multiple constituent modules (although this list
is subject to change over time, Perl and Python). Each of these modules
has a source directory in this project.  When the unified bookset is
built, however, it has to reference some unified items - introductory and
appendix material - which can't easily be reconstitued from the individual
module directories.  This directory exists only to house that material,
and does not otherwise contain specification material.
