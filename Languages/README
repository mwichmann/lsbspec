Module directory for LSB-Languages

LSB-Languages consists of multiple constituent submodules, subject to change
over time.  For LSB 5.0:

	Perl, Python, XML

Each of these submodules has a source directory in this project.  When the
unified bookset is built, however, it has to reference some unified items
- introductory and appendix material - which can't easily be reconstitued
from the individual submodule directories.  This directory exists only
to house that material, and does not otherwise contain specification
material.
