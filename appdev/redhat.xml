          The &lsb; development environment requires a Linux 2.4 kernel.
          Redhat 7.1 and 7.2 include Linux 2.4 kernels by default.  If you
          are not running Redhat 7.1 or 7.2, you should install a Linux 2.4
          kernel.

          The &lsb; development environment requires an existing ssh server
          running on the lsbdev machine and files provided by the
          glibc-devel and binutils packages.  If you do not have binutils,
          glibc-devel, and openssh-server installed, you should install
          them.

          Edit the lsbdev configuration files (lsbdev.conf,
          extra_mount_dirs.conf, extra_mount_files.conf) in /etc/lsbdev/ 
          to your liking.  The lsbdev.conf file is used to configure the
          overall &lsb; build environment chroot.  Configuration options
          include the location of the chroot environment on the local 
          filesystem, the location of the &lsb; stub libraries, a space 
          separated list of users whose home directories will be 
          automatically bind-mounted into the chroot area, the location of
          the &lsb; header files, among others. The extra_mount_dirs.conf 
          file is used to configure additional directories to be 
          bind-mounted into the chroot area.  The extra_mount_files.conf 
          file is used to configure additional files to be bind-mounted 
          into the chroot area.

          The &lsb; header files are included in the lsbdev package, but
          disabled by default.  To enable the inclusion of the &lsb; header
          files, edit the /etc/lsbdev/lsbdev.conf file and change the
          LSB_INCLUDE line to LSB_INCLUDE=$DATA_ROOT/lsb_header or the
          location of the &lsb; header files on your system.  The &lsb; 
          header files are located in /var/opt/lsbdev/lsb_header by
          default.

          You now have configured a RedHat system for &lsb;-compliant
          application development.  Once you have compiled your
          application, you should run the <command>lsbappchk</command>
          program against your executable(s) to verify that they are
          &lsb;-compliant.
