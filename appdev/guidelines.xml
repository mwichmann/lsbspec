    <title>APIs for &lsb;-Compliant Applications</title>

    <para>
      &lsb;-compliant applications should only use APIs that are specified 
      in sections IV, V, or VI of the &lsb;. Section IV of the g&lsb;
      details base libraries that provide interfaces for accessing the
      operating system, processor, and other hardware in the system.  Section 
      V details utility libraries that are built on top of the interfaces
      provided by the base libraries.  These libraries implement common
      functionality and hide additional system dependent information such
      as file formats and device names.  Section VI details graphic
      libraries, that is, X libraries.

    <title>What to Expect from an &lsb;-Compliant Environment</title>

    <para>
      The &glsb; defines a minimal set of utilities that must be
      present.  Other commands will almost certainly be present in a
      compliant environment, but compliant applications must not rely on
      their presence.
    </para>
      
    <para>
      A <literal>POSIX-1003.2</literal> shell must be available in an
      &lsb;-compliant environment. Currently, the &glsb; defines minor 
      exceptions so that <application>bash</application> meets its 
      requirements.
