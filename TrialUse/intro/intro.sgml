<PARA>
This is version &specversion; of the Trial Use Specification.
This version is a preliminary version for review only. Conclusion of work on
this version will result in version 3.2 of the Trial Use Specification.
</PARA>
<PARA>
This specification describes components which have Trial Use Specification
status, and as such there is no formal compliance process for
this specification. Implementations may claim to provide these components
in a manner that agrees with this specification, but such a claim is not
part of a conformance statement for the LSB version in which this module
appears.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Applications may not assume that the components of this specification
are present or operate as described in this specification on any
given implementation. 
</PARA>
<!-- we don't use this in modules
<PARA>
An implementation of this version of the specification may not claim
to be an implementation of LSB-TrialUse Specification unless it has successfully
completed the compliance process as defined by the Linux Foundation.

<PARA>
The Trial Use Specification describes components which may or
may not be present on an otherwise conforming system. The
purpose is to indicate that these components are on a Standards
Track, that is, they are intended to become part of the LSB
Specification in a future edition.

The specifications listed below are referenced in whole or in part by
the Trial Use Specification.  Such references may be normative or
informative; a reference to specification shall only be considered
normative if it is explicitly cited as such.  The Trial Use
Specification may make normative references to a portion of these
specifications (that is, to define a specific function or group of
functions); in such cases, only the explicitly referenced portion of
the specification is to be considered normative.

<PARA>For the purposes of this document, the following terms apply:
</PARA>
<VARIABLELIST>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>
implementation-defined
</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
Describes a value or
behavior that is not defined by this document but is selected by an
implementor. The value or behavior may vary among implementations
that conform to this document. An application should not rely on the
existence of the value or behavior. An application that relies on such
a value or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across conforming
implementations.  The implementor shall document such a value or behavior
so that it can be used correctly by an application.
</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>
Shell Script
</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
A file that is read by an interpreter (e.g., awk). The first line of the shell script includes a reference to its interpreter binary.
</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</VARLISTENTRY>


<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>
undefined
</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
Describes the nature of a value or behavior not defined by this document
which results from use of an invalid program construct or invalid
data input.  The value or behavior may vary among implementations that
conform to this document. An application should not rely on the existence
or validity of the value or behavior. An application that relies on any
particular value or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across
conforming implementations.
