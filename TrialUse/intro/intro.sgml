This is version &specversion; of the Trial Use Specification.
This version is a preliminary version for review only. Conclusion of work on
this version will result in version &targetversion; of the Trial Use Specification.
This specification augments the series of volumes released under 
the collective title <citetitle>Linux Standard Base</citetitle>:

This document describes components which have Trial Use Specification
status, and as such there is no formal compliance process for
this specification. Implementations may claim to provide these components
in a manner that agrees with this specification, but such a claim is not
part of a conformance statement for the LSB version in which this module
appears.

<PARA>
Applications may not assume that the components of this specification
are present or operate as described in this specification on any
given implementation.

Please enter your feedback, carefully indicating the title of the
section for which you are submitting feedback, and the volume and
version of the specification where you found the problem, quoting
the incorrect text if appropriate. If you are suggesting a new feature,
please indicate what the problem you are trying to solve is. That is
more important than the solution, in fact.  </para>

<PARA>
The Trial Use Specification describes components which may or
may not be present on an otherwise conforming system. The
purpose is to indicate that these components are on a Standards
Track, that is, they are intended to become part of the LSB
Specification in a future edition.

The specifications listed below are referenced in whole or in part by
the Trial Use Specification.  Such references may be normative or
informative; a reference to specification shall only be considered
normative if it is explicitly cited as such.  The Trial Use
Specification may make normative references to a portion of these
specifications (that is, to define a specific function or group of
functions); in such cases, only the explicitly referenced portion of
the specification is to be considered normative.
