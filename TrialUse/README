This is a dummy module specification.

LSB-TrialUse consists of multiple constituent modules (the list
changes per release).  Each of these modules has a source directory
in this project.  When the unified bookset is built, however, it has
to reference some unified items - introductory and appendix material -
which can't easily be reconstitued from the individual module directories.
This directory exists only to house that material, and does not otherwise
contain specification material.
