Module directory for LSB-TrialUse

LSB-TrialUse consists of multiple constituent submodules, with the list
changing per release, but always including TUM, which is a submodule
to hold trial-use components which are too small to get their own
submodule.

Each of these submodules has a source directory in this project.  When the
unified bookset is built, however, it has to reference some unified items
- introductory and appendix material - which can't easily be reconstitued
from the individual submodule directories.  This directory exists only
to house that material, and does not otherwise contain specification
material.
