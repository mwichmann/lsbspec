<VARIABLELIST>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>
implementation-defined
</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
Describes a value or
behavior that is not defined by this document but is selected by an
implementor. The value or behavior may vary among implementations
that conform to this document. An application should not rely on the
existence of the value or behavior. An application that relies on such
a value or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across conforming
implementations.  The implementor shall document such a value or behavior
so that it can be used correctly by an application.
</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>
Shell Script
</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>

</VARLISTENTRY>


<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>
undefined
</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
Describes the nature of a value or behavior not defined by this document
which results from use of an invalid program construct or invalid
data input.  The value or behavior may vary among implementations that
conform to this document. An application should not rely on the existence
or validity of the value or behavior. An application that relies on any
particular value or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across
conforming implementations.
</PARA>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>

<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
Describes the nature of a value or behavior not specified by this document
which results from use of a valid program construct or valid data input.
The value or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to this
document. An application should not rely on the existence or validity
of the value or behavior. An application that relies on any particular
value or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across conforming
implementations.
