<ENTRY>DW_CFA_expression</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>0x10</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>The DW_CFA_expression instruction takes two operands: an unsigned LEB128 value representing a
register number, and a DW_FORM_block value representing a DWARF expression. The required action is to
establish the DWARF expression as the means by which the address in which the given register contents
are found may be computed. The value of the CFA is pushed on the DWARF evaluation stack prior to
execution of the DWARF expression. The DW_OP_call2, DW_OP_call4, DW_OP_call_ref and
DW_OP_push_object_address DWARF operators (see Section 2.4.1 of <XREF LINKEND="std.DWARF2">) cannot be
used in such a DWARF expression.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY>DW_CFA_offset_extended_sf</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>0x11</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>
The DW_CFA_offset_extended_sf instruction takes two operands: an unsigned LEB128 value representing a
register number and a signed LEB128 factored offset. This instruction is identical to
DW_CFA_offset_extended except that the second operand is signed.
</ENTRY>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<ENTRY>DW_CFA_def_cfa_sf</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>0x12</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>
The DW_CFA_def_cfa_sf instruction takes two operands: an unsigned LEB128 value representing a register
number and a signed LEB128 factored offset. This instruction is identical to DW_CFA_def_cfa except that
the second operand is signed and factored.
</ENTRY>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<ENTRY>DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset_sf</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>0x13</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>
The DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset_sf instruction takes a signed LEB128 operand representing a factored offset.
This instruction is identical to DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset except that the operand is signed and factored.
</ENTRY>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<ENTRY>DW_CFA_GNU_args_size</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>0x2e</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>
The DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset_sf instruction takes an unsigned LEB128 operand representing an argument size.
</ENTRY>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<ENTRY>DW_CFA_GNU_negative_offset_extended</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>0x2f</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>
The DW_CFA_def_cfa_sf instruction takes two operands: an unsigned LEB128 value representing a register
number and an unsigned LEB128 which represents the magnitude of the offset. This instruction is identical
to DW_CFA_offset_extended_sf except that the operand is subtracted to produce the offset. This
instructions is obsoleted by DW_CFA_offset_extended_sf.
