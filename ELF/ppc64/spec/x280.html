><P
>For a RISC machine such as 64-bit PowerPC, it is generally more efficient to pass arguments to 
			called functions in registers (both general and floating-point registers) than to construct an argument list in 
			storage or to push them onto a stack.  Since all computations must be performed in registers anyway, 
			memory traffic can be eliminated if the caller can compute arguments into registers and pass them in the 
			same registers to the called function, where the called function can then use them for further computation in 
			 the same registers.  The number of registers implemented in a processor architecture naturally limits the 
			number of arguments that can be passed in this manner.
			</P
><P
>			For the 64-bit PowerPC, up to eight doublewords are passed in
			general purpose registers, loaded sequentially into general
			purpose registers r3 through r10.  Up to thirteen floating-point
			arguments can be passed in floating-point registers f1 through
			f13.  If VMX is supported, up to twelve vector parameters can
			be passed in v2 through v13.  If fewer (or no) arguments are
			passed, the unneeded registers are not loaded and will contain
			undefined values on entry to the called function.
			</P
><P
>The parameter save area, which is located at a fixed offset of 48 bytes from the stack pointer, is 
			reserved in each stack frame for use as an argument list.  A minimum of 8 doublewords is always reserved.
			  The size of this area must be sufficient to hold the longest argument list being passed by the function 
			which owns the stack frame.  Although not all arguments for a particular call are located in storage, 
			consider them to be forming a list in this area, with each argument occupying one or more doublewords.
			</P
><P
>If more arguments are passed than can be stored in registers, the remaining arguments are stored in 
			the parameter save area.  The values passed on the stack are identical to those that have been placed in 
			registers; thus, the stack contains register images.
			</P
><P
>			 For variable argument lists, this ABI uses a va_list type which
			 is a pointer to the memory location of the next parameter.
			 Using a simple va_list type means that variable arguments must
			 always be in the same location regardless of type, so that they
			 can be found at runtime.  This ABI defines the location to be
			 general registers r3 through r10 for the first eight
			 doublewords and the stack parameter save area thereafter.
			 Alignment requirements such as those for vector types may
			 require the va_list pointer to first be aligned before
			 accessing a value.

>Functions shall return values of type int, long, enum, short, and char, or a pointer to any type, as 
			unsigned or signed integers as appropriate, zero- or sign-extended to 64 bits if necessary, in r3.  Character 
			 arrays of length 8 bytes or less, or bit strings of length 64 bits or less, will be returned right justified in r3.  
			Aggregates or unions of any length, and character strings of length longer than 8 bytes, will be returned in 
			a storage buffer allocated by the caller.  The caller will pass the address of this buffer as a hidden first 
			argument in r3, causing the first explicit argument to be passed in r4.  This hidden argument is treated as a 
			normal formal parameter, and corresponds to the first doubleword of the parameter save area.

><P
>A function descriptor is a three doubleword data structure that contains the following values:
			</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The first doubleword contains the address of the entry point of the 
					function.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The second doubleword contains the TOC base address for the 
					function (see <A
HREF="x804.html"
>Section 4.3</A
> later in this chapter).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The third doubleword contains the environment pointer for languages 
					such as Pascal and PL/1.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>For an externally visible function, the value of the symbol with the same name as the function is the 
			address of the function descriptor.  Symbol names with a dot (.) prefix are reserved for holding entry point 
			addresses.  The value of a symbol named &quot;.FN&quot; is the entry point of the function &quot;FN&quot;.
			</P
><P
>The value of a function pointer in a language like C is the address of the function descriptor.  
			Examples of calling a function through a pointer are provided in <A
HREF="x572.html#FUNC-CALLS"
>Section 3.5.11</A
>.

>When the link editor processes relocatable object files in order to produce an executable or shared
