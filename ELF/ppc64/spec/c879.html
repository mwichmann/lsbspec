>As the system creates or augments a process image, it logically copies
a file's segment to a virtual memory segment.  When--and if--the
system physically reads the file depends on the program's execution
behavior, system load, and so on.  A process does not require a
physical page unless it references the logical page during execution,
and processes commonly leave many pages unreferenced.  Therefore,
delaying physical reads frequently obviates them, improving system
performance.  To obtain this efficiency in practice, executable and
shared object files must have segment images whose offsets and virtual
addresses are congruent, modulo the page size.
		</P
><P
>Virtual addresses and file offsets for the 64-bit PowerPC processor
family segments are congruent modulo 64 Kbytes (0x10000) or larger
powers of 2.  Although 4096 bytes is currently the 64-bit PowerPC page
size, this allows files to be suitable for paging even if
implementations appear with larger page sizes.  The value of the
p_align member of each program header in a shared object file must be
0x10000.
		</P
><P
>It is normally desirable to put segments with different
characteristics in separate 256 Mbyte portions of the address space,
to give the operating system full paging flexibility in the 64-bit
address space.
		</P
><P
>Here is an example of an executable file assuming an executable
program linked with a base address of 0x10000000.

>Logically, the system enforces memory permissions as if each segment
were complete and separate; segment addresses are adjusted to ensure
that each logical page in the address space has a single set of
permissions.  In the example above, the file region holding the end of
text and the beginning of data is mapped twice; at one virtual address
for text and at a different virtual address for data.
		</P
><P
>The end of the data segment requires special handling for
uninitialized data, which the system defines to begin with zero
values.  Thus if the last data page of a file includes information not
in the logical memory page, the extraneous data must be set to zero,
rather than to the unknown contents of the executable file.
"Impurities" in the other three pages are not logically part of the
process image; whether the system expunges them is unspecified.  The
memory image for the program above is shown here, assuming 4096
(0x1000) byte pages.

>One aspect of segment loading differs between executable files and
shared objects.  Executable file segments may contain absolute code.
For the process to execute correctly, the segments must reside at the
virtual addresses assigned when building the executable file, with the
system using the p_vaddr values unchanged as virtual addresses.
		</P
><P
>On the other hand, shared object segments typically contain
position-independent code.  This allows a segment's virtual address to
change from one process to another, without invalidating execution
behavior.
		</P
><P
>Though the system chooses virtual addresses for individual processes,
most systems will maintain the "relative positions" of the segments.
Any use of relative addressing between segments should be indicated by
an appropriate dynamic relocation.  If the dynamic linker does not
maintain the relative position of segments at load time, it must be
careful in its handling of R_PPC64_RELATIVE relocations, examining the
relative address in order to determine the appropriate base address to
use.
		</P
><P
>The following table shows possible shared object virtual address
assignments for several processes, illustrating constant relative
positioning.  The table also illustrates the base address
computations.
