		register usage, and stack frame layout. Programming language systems use this initial program state to establish a 
		standard environment for their application programs.  For example, a C program begins executing at a function named 
		main, conventionally declared as follows:

AT_PHENT, AT_PHNUM, and AT_ENTRY must also be present.  See the

environment, and auxiliary vector from exec.  Argument strings,
environment strings, and the auxiliary information appear in no
specific order within the information block; the system makes no
guarantees about their relative arrangement.  The system may also
leave an unspecified amount of memory between the null auxiliary
vector entry and the beginning of the information block.  The back
chain word of the first stack frame contains a null pointer (0).
