>Position-independent code cannot, in general, contain absolute virtual
addresses.  The global offset table, which is part of the TOC section,
holds absolute addresses in private data, thus making the addresses
available without compromising the position-independence and
sharability of a program's text.  A program references its TOC using
position-independent addressing and extracts absolute values, thus
redirecting position-independent references to absolute locations.
			</P
><P
>When the dynamic linker creates memory segments for a loadable object
file, it processes the relocation entries, some of which will be of
type R_PPC64_GLOB_DAT, referring to the global offset table within the
TOC.  The dynamic linker determines the associated symbol values,
calculates their absolute addresses, and sets the global offset table
entries to the proper values.  Although the absolute addresses are
unknown when the link editor builds an object file, the dynamic linker
knows the addresses of all memory segments and can thus calculate the
absolute addresses of the symbols contained therein.
			</P
><P
>A global offset table entry provides direct access to the absolute
address of a symbol without compromising position-independence and
sharability.  Because the executable file and shared objects have
separate global offset tables, a symbol may appear in several tables.
The dynamic linker processes all the global offset table relocations
before giving control to any code in the process image, thus ensuring
the absolute addresses are available during execution.
			</P
><P
>The global offset table is part of the TOC section.  Since different
functions in a single executable or shared object may have different
TOC sections, the global offset table may also be replicated, in whole
or in part.  Each instance of the global offset table will have its
own set of relocations.  The dynamic linker need not know about the
replication; it simply processes all the relocations it is given.
			</P
><P
>The dynamic linker may choose different memory segment addresses for
the same shared object in different programs; it may even choose
different library addresses for different executions of the same
program.  Nonetheless, memory segments do not change addresses once
the process image is established.  As long as a process exists, its
memory segments reside at fixed virtual addresses.
			</P

executable or shared object.

>References to the address of a function from an executable file and
the shared objects associated with it need to resolve to the same
value.
			</P
><P
>In this ABI, the address of a function is actually the address of a
function descriptor.  A reference to a function, other than a function
call, will normally load the address of the function descriptor from
the global offset table.  The dynamic linker will ensure that for a
given function, the same address is used for all references to the
function from any global offset table.  Thus, function address
comparisons will work as expected.
			</P
><P
>When making a call to the function, the code may refer to the
procedure linkage table entry, in order to permit lazy symbol
resolution at run time.  In order to support correct function address
comparisons, the compiler should be careful to only generate
references to the procedure linkage table entry for function calls.
For any other use of a function, the compiler should use the real
address.
			</P
><P
>When using the ELF assembler syntax, this means that the compiler
should use the @got syntax, rather than the @got@plt syntax, if the
function address is going to be used without being called.

NAME="PROC-LINK"
>5.2.4. Procedure Linkage Table</A
></H2
><P
>The procedure linkage table may be used to redirect function calls
between the executable and a shared object or between different shared
objects.  Because all function calls on the 64-bit PowerPC are done via
function descriptors, the procedure linkage table is simply a special
case of a function descriptor which is filled in by the dynamic linker
rather than the link editor.
			</P
><P
>The procedure linkage table is purely an optimization designed to
permit lazy symbol resolution at run time.  The link editor may
generate R_PPC64_GLOB_DAT relocations for all function descriptors
defined in other shared objects, and avoid generating a procedure
linkage table at all.
			</P
><P
>The procedure linkage table is normally found in the .plt section in
an executable or shared object.  Its contents are not initialized in
the executable or shared object file.  Instead, the link editor simply
reserves space for it, and the dynamic linker initializes it and
manages it according to its own, possibly implementation-dependent
needs, subject to the following constraint:
			</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>If the executable or shared object requires N procedure linkage table
  entries, the link editor shall reserve 3*(N+1) doublewords (24*(N+1)
  bytes).  These doublewords will be used to hold function descriptors.
  When calling function i, the link editor arranges to use the function
  descriptor at byte 24 * i.  The first procedure linkage table entry
  is reserved for use by the dynamic linker.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>As mentioned before, a relocation table is associated with the
procedure linkage table.  The DT_JMPREL entry in the dynamic section
gives the location of the first relocation entry.  The relocation
table's entries parallel the procedure linkage table entries in a
one-to-one correspondence.  That is, relocation table entry 1 applies
to procedure linkage table entry 1, and so on.  The relocation type
for each entry shall be R_PPC64_JMP_SLOT, the relocation offset shall
specify the address of the first byte of the associated procedure
linkage table entry, and the symbol table index shall reference the
appropriate symbol.
			</P
><P
>The dynamic linker will locate the symbol referenced by the
R_PPC64_JMP_SLOT relocation.  The value of the symbol will be the
address of the function descriptor.  The dynamic linker will copy
these 24 bytes into the procedure linkage table entry.
			</P
><P
>The dynamic linker can resolve the procedure linkage table relocations
lazily, resolving them only when they are needed.  This can speed up
program startup time.
			</P
><P
>The following code shows how the dynamic linker might initialize the
procedure linkage table in order to provide lazy resolution:

><P
>As shown above, each procedure linkage table entry I, as initialized by
the link editor, transfers control to the corresponding glink entry I at
.GLINKI.  The instructions at .GLINKI loads a relocation index into r0 and
branches to the common .GLINK0 code, the first entry in the GLINK table.
For example, assume the program calls NAME, which uses the function
descriptor at the label .PLTi.  The function descriptor causes the program
to branch to .GLINKi which loads i - 1 into r0 and branches to .GLINK0.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>.GLINK0 loads three values from the PLT Reserve area allocated by the
link editor and initialized by the dynamic linker.  The first doubleword
is the dynamic linker's lazy binding entry point.  The second doubleword
is the dynamic linker's own TOC anchor value.  The third doubleword is an
8-byte identifier unique to the calling module which must be placed into
r11 (normally the static chain), so that the dynamic linker can identify
the object from which the call originated, and thereby located that
object's relocation table.  .GLINK0 then calls into the dynamic linker
with the PLT index copied into r0 and the identifying information copied
into r11.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The dynamic linker finds relocation entry i corresponding to the
index in r0.  It will have type R_PPC_JMP_SLOT, its offset will
specify the address of .PLTi, and its symbol table index will
reference NAME.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Knowing this, the dynamic linker finds the symbol's "real" value.
It then copies the function descriptor into the code at .PLTi.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Subsequent executions of the procedure linkage table entry will
transfer control directly to the function via the function descriptor
at .PLTi, without invoking the dynamic linker.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>The LD_BIND_NOW environment variable can change dynamic linking
behavior.  If its value is non-null, the dynamic linker resolves the
function call binding at load time, before transferring control to the
program.  That is, the dynamic linker processes relocation entries of
type R_PPC_JMP_SLOT during process initialization.  Otherwise, the
dynamic linker evaluates procedure linkage table entries lazily,
delaying symbol resolution and relocation until the first execution of
a table entry.
			</P
><P
>Lazy binding generally improves overall application performance
because unused symbols do not incur the dynamic linking overhead.
Nevertheless, two situations make lazy binding undesirable for some
applications:
			</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The initial reference to a shared object function takes longer than
subsequent calls because the dynamic linker intercepts the call to
resolve the symbol, and some applications cannot tolerate this
unpredictability.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>If an error occurs and the dynamic linker cannot resolve the
symbol, the dynamic linker will terminate the program.  Under lazy
binding, this might occur at arbitrary times.  Once again, some
applications cannot tolerate this unpredictability.  By turning off
lazy binding, the dynamic linker forces the failure to occur during
process initialization, before the application receives control.</P
