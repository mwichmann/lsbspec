></H2
><P
>For a RISC machine such as 64-bit PowerPC, it is generally more efficient to pass arguments to 
			called functions in registers (both general and floating-point registers) than to construct an argument list in 
			storage or to push them onto a stack.  Since all computations must be performed in registers anyway, 
			memory traffic can be eliminated if the caller can compute arguments into registers and pass them in the 
			same registers to the called function, where the called function can then use them for further computation in 
			 the same registers.  The number of registers implemented in a processor architecture naturally limits the 
			number of arguments that can be passed in this manner.
			</P
><P
>For the 64-bit PowerPC, up to eight doublewords are passed in general purpose registers, loaded 
			sequentially into general purpose registers r3 through r10.  In addition, up to thirteen floating-point 
			arguments can be passed in floating-point registers f1 through f13.  If fewer (or no) arguments are passed, 
			the unneeded registers are not loaded and will contain undefined values on entry to the called function. 
			</P
><P
>The parameter save area, which is located at a fixed offset of 48 bytes from the stack pointer, is 
			reserved in each stack frame for use as an argument list.  A minimum of 8 doublewords is always reserved.
			  The size of this area must be sufficient to hold the longest argument list being passed by the function 
			which owns the stack frame.  Although not all arguments for a particular call are located in storage, 
			consider them to be forming a list in this area, with each argument occupying one or more doublewords.
			</P
><P
>If more arguments are passed than can be stored in registers, the remaining arguments are stored in 
			the parameter save area.  The values passed on the stack are identical to those that have been placed in 
			registers; thus, the stack contains register images.
