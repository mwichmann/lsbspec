when -l is used with this option the sort order is
by name, rather than by ctime as the SUS requires.

this option applies to entries in the file system specified on
the command line. Normally when such options are directories, the
contents of the directory are listed along with the directory. When
this option is present these command line entries will be treated as
though they were normal files, and their contents will not be listed.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The SUS makes no mention that this behavior pertains to command line entries,
and only specifies behavior already otherwise present without the option.
The SUS makes no implication of any additional behavior aside from that
already specified.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The behavior of the Linux version of ls is entirely unexpected, given
either SUS or the completely specified behavior presented above. Aside
from the parent directory, the -d option for ls lists only those
items specified on the command line, listing only the names of directories,
and not their contents, but listing nothing else in this file system path
that is not specified by the command line file list.

this parameter alone does nothing. Only when used with -l does it exhibit
the SUS declared behavior of displaying uid/gid instead of uname and gname.

as well as the slash declared by SUS, this option will also display
the *, @, and | characters for executables, links, and FIFOs, respectively.
