<TITLE>Description</TITLE>
<PARA>
<COMMAND>chfn</COMMAND> shall update the user database.
An unprivileged user may only change the fields for their own account, 
a user with appropriate privileges may change the fields for any account.</PARA>

<PARA>
The fields <PARAMETER>full_name</PARAMETER> and <PARAMETER>home_phone</PARAMETER> may contain any
character except:
<SIMPLELIST>
<member>any control character</member>
<member>comma</member>
<member>colon</member>
<member>equal sign</member>
</SIMPLELIST>
</PARA>

<PARA>
If none of the options are selected, <COMMAND>chfn</COMMAND> operates 
in an interactive fashion. The prompts and expected input in interactive 
mode are unspecified and should not be relied upon.
</PARA>

<PARA>
As it is possible for the system to be configured to restrict which
fields a non-privileged user is permitted to change, applications
should be written to gracefully handle these situations.

<TITLE>Future Directions</TITLE>
<para>
The following two options are expected to be added in a future
version of the LSB:</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>-o office</term>
<listitem>
<para>
sets the user's office room number.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>-p office_phone</term>
<listitem>
<para>
sets the user's office phone number.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>
Note that some implementations contain a "-o other" option which
specifies an additional field called "other".  Traditionally, this
field is not subject to the constraints about legitimate characters in
fields.  Also, one traditionally shall have appropriate privileges to
change the other field.  At this point there is no consensus about
whether it is desirable to specify the other field; applications may
wish to avoid using it.
</para>

<para>
The "-w work_phone" field found in some implementations should be
replaced by the "-p office_phone" field.  The "-r room_number" field
found in some implementations is the equivalent of the "-o office"
option mentioned above; which one of these two options to specify will
depend on implementation experience and the decision regarding the
other field.
