This version is a preliminary version for review only. Conclusion of work on
this version will result in version 2.0 of the Linx Standard Base
Specification.

An implementation of this version of the specification may not claim

<PARA>
The LSB defines a binary interface for application programs that are compiled
and packaged for LSB-conforming implementations on many different hardware
architectures. Since a binary specification shall include information specific
to the computer processor architecture for which it is intended, it is not
possible for a single document to specify the interface for all possible
LSB-conforming implementations. Therefore, the LSB is a family of
specifications, rather than a single one.

<PARA>
This document should be used in conjunction with the documents it references.
This document enumerates the system components it includes, but descriptions of
those components may be included entirely or partly in this document, partly in
other documents, or entirely in other reference documents. For example, the
section that describes system service routines includes a list of the system
routines supported in this interface, formal declarations of the data
structures they use that are visible to applications, and a pointer to the
underlying referenced specification for information about the syntax and
semantics of each call. Only those routines not described in standards
referenced by this document, or extensions to those standards, are described in
the detail. Information referenced in this way is as much a part of this
document as is the information explicitly included here.
