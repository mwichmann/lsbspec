<TITLE>Implementation may set O_LARGEFILE
</TITLE>
<PARA>
According to the Single UNIX Specification, only an application sets
fcntl flags, for example O_LARGEFILE.  However, this specification
also allows implementations to set O_LARGEFILE in a case in which the
default behavior matches the O_LARGEFILE behavior.<footnote><para>For
example, if off_t is 64 bits</para></footnote>  Or in other words,
calling fcntl with the F_GETFL command may return O_LARGEFILE as well
as flags explicitly set by the application.
