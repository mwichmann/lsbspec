and the user's accessibility to the system. It is typically called 
after the user has been authenticated.
</PARA>
<PARA>
<PARAMETER>flags</PARAMETER> may be specified as any valid flag (namely, 
one of those applicable to the <PARAMETER>flags</PARAMETER> argument of 
<FUNCTION>pam_authenticate</FUNCTION>). Additionally, the value of 
<PARAMETER>flags</PARAMETER> may be logically <LITERAL>OR</LITERAL>'d

<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
User is valid, but user's authentication token has expired.
The correct response to this return-value is to require that the
user satisfy the <FUNCTION>pam_chauthtok</FUNCTION> function before 
obtaining service. It may not be possible for an application to do 
this. In such a case, the user should be denied access until the
account password is updated.
