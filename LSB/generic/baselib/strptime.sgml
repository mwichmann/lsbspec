<TITLE>Number of leading zeroes may be limited
</TITLE>
<PARA>
The <CITETITLE PUBWORK="BOOK"><XREF LINKEND=STD.SUSv3>
</CITETITLE> specifies fields for which "leading zeros are
permitted but not required"; however, applications shall not expect to 
be able to supply more leading zeroes for these fields than would be 
implied by the range of the field. Implementations may choose to 
either match an input with excess leading zeroes, or treat this as a 
non-matching input.  For example, <VARNAME>%j</VARNAME> has a range of 
<LITERAL>001</LITERAL> to <LITERAL>366</LITERAL>, so <LITERAL>0</LITERAL>, 
<LITERAL>00</LITERAL>, <LITERAL>000</LITERAL>, <LITERAL>001</LITERAL>, 
and <LITERAL>045</LITERAL> are acceptable inputs, but inputs such as 
<LITERAL>0000</LITERAL>, <LITERAL>0366</LITERAL> and the like are not.

<REFSECT1>
<TITLE>Rationale
</TITLE>
<PARA>
<EMPHASIS>glibc</EMPHASIS> developers consider it appropriate behavior 
to forbid excess leading zeroes.  When trying to parse a given input
against several format strings, forbidding excess leading zeroes could
be helpful.  For example, if one matches <LITERAL>0011-12-26</LITERAL> 
against <LITERAL>%m-%d-%Y</LITERAL> and then against 
<LITERAL>%Y-%m-%d</LITERAL>, it seems useful for the first match to fail, 
as it would be perverse to parse that date as November 12, year 26.  
The second pattern parses it as December 26, year 11.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The <CITETITLE PUBWORK="BOOK"><XREF LINKEND=STD.SUSv3></CITETITLE> is 
not explicit that an unlimited number of leading zeroes are required, 
although it may imply this. The <ACRONYM>LSB</ACRONYM> explicitly 
allows implementations to have either behavior. Future versions of this 
standard may require implementations to forbid excess leading zeroes.
</PARA>
<PARA>
An Interpretation Request is
currently pending against <XREF LINKEND=STD.SUSV3> for this matter.
