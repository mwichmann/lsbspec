<TITLE>Description
</TITLE>
<PARA>
The specification for "kill" is as specified in the SUSv2 but with the
following differences as listed below.
</PARA>

<REFSECT2>
<TITLE>Process ID -1 doesn't affect calling process
</TITLE>
<PARA>
If <replaceable>pid</replaceable> is specified as -1,
<replaceable>sig</replaceable> shall not be sent to the calling
process.  Other than this, the rules in the SUSv2 apply.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Rationale: Linux users/programs expect to exclude the calling process,
which is the historic Linux behavior.  After an experiment with
including the calling process in 2.5.1 Linus has decided to go back to
the traditional Linux behavior.  Affected programs include killall5
and some versions of shutdown.  Another example is the shell command
"kill -KILL -1" which is expected to not kill the shell from which it
is run.  See "What does it mean to signal everybody?", Linux Weekly
News, 20 December 2001 ( http://lwn.net/2001/1220/kernel.php3 ).
