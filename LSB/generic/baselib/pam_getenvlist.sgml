<TITLE>Description
</TITLE>
<PARA>
<FUNCTION>pam_getenvlist</FUNCTION> returns a pointer to the complete 
PAM environment. This pointer points to an array of pointers to
<CONSTANT>NUL</CONSTANT>-terminated strings and must be terminated by a
<CONSTANT>NULL</CONSTANT> pointer. Each string has the form "name=value".
</PARA>
<PARA>
The PAM library module allocates memory for the returned value and the
associated strings. The calling application is responsible for freeing this
memory.
