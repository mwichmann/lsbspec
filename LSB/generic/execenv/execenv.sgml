<TITLE>File System Hierarchy</TITLE>
<PARA>
An LSB conforming implementation shall provide the mandatory portions of the
filesystem hierarchy specified in the <XREF LINKEND="STD.FHS"> (FHS),
together with any additional requirements made in this specification.
</PARA>
<PARA>
An LSB conforming application shall conform to the <XREF LINKEND="STD.FHS">.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The FHS allows many components or subsystems to be optional. An application
shall check for the existence of an optional component before using it, and
should behave in a reasonable manner if the optional component is not
present.
</PARA>
<para>
The FHS requirement to locate the operating system kernel in either
<filename>/</filename> or <filename>/boot</filename> does not apply if
the operating system kernel does not exist as a file in the filesystem.
</para>
<para>
The FHS specifies certain behaviors for a variety of commands if they
are present (for example, ping or python).  However, LSB applications
shall not rely on any commands beyond those specified by the LSB.  The
mere existence of a command may not be used as an indication that the
command behaves in any particular way.
</para>
<para>
The following directories or links need not be present:
<filename>/etc/X11</filename>

<filename>/usr/lib/X11</filename>
<filename>/proc</filename>

<TITLE>Minimal granted Directory and File permissions</TITLE>

<PARA>
In this Chapter "System" means an "LSB conforming implementation" and
"application" means an "LSB conforming (third party vendor) application".
</PARA>

<PARA>
The system shall grant to the application read and execute              
permissions on files needed to use all system interfaces (ABIs)                 
required by the LSB specification.

<SECT1 id=permissions-should>
<TITLE>Recommendations for applications on ownership and permissions</TITLE>

<SECT2 id=permissions-dirwrite>
<TITLE>Directory Write Permissions</TITLE>

<PARA>
The application should not depend on having directory write 
permission outside <filename>/tmp</filename>, 
<filename>/var/tmp</filename>, invoking user's home directory and
<filename>/var/opt/<replaceable>package</replaceable></filename>,
(where <replaceable>package</replaceable> is the name of the 
application package). 
</PARA>

<PARA>
The application should not depend on owning these directories.
<!-- What do we mean here?  Can an application create
/var/opt/<package>/<subdir> and own it? -->
</PARA>

<PARA>
For these directories the application should be able to work 
with directory write permissions restricted by the 
<CONSTANT>S_ISVTXT</CONSTANT> bit (otherwise known as the "sticky bit").
</PARA>
 
</SECT2>
 
<SECT2 id=permissions-filewrite>
<TITLE>File Write Permissions</TITLE>

files not owned by the user it runs under with the exception 
of its personal inbox <filename>/var/mail/<replaceable>username</replaceable></filename>.

</SECT2>

<SECT2 id=permissions-sbits>
<TITLE>Suid and Sgid Permissions </TITLE>
 
<PARA>
The application should not depend on the set user ID or set group ID
(the <CONSTANT>S_ISUID</CONSTANT> or <CONSTANT>S_ISGID</CONSTANT>
permissions of a 
file not packaged with the application. Instead, the distribution is 
responsible for assuming that all system commands have the required 
permissions and work correctly.
</PARA>

<NOTE><TITLE>Rationale</TITLE>
<PARA>
In order to implement common security policies it is strongly advisable
for applications to use the minimum set of security attributes necessary for
correct operation. Applications that require substantial appropriate privilege
are likely to cause problems with such security policies.
</PARA>
</NOTE>
</SECT2>
 
<SECT2 id=priviledged-users>
<TITLE>Privileged users</TITLE>

<PARA>
In general, applications should not depend on running as a privileged user.
This specification uses the term "appropriate privilege" throughout to identify
operations that cannot be achieved without some special granting of additional
privilege.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Applications that have a reason to run with appropriate privilege
should outline this reason clearly in their documentation.
Users of the application should be informed, that "this application 
demands security privileges, which could interfere with system security".
</PARA>

<PARA>
The application should not contain binary-only software that 
requires being run with appropriate privilege, as this makes security auditing 
harder or even impossible. 
</PARA>

</SECT2>

<SECT2 id=changing-permissions>
<TITLE>Changing permissions</TITLE>

<PARA>
The application shall not change permissions of files and 
directories that do not belong to its own package. 
Should an application require that certain files and directories
not directly belonging to the package have a particular ownership,
the application shall document this requirement, and may fail during
installation if the permissions on these files is inappropriate.
</PARA>

</SECT2>

<SECT2 id=permission-media>
<TITLE>Removable Media (Cdrom, Floppy, etc.)</TITLE>

<para>
Applications that expect to be runnable from removable
media should not depend on logging in as a privileged user,
and should be prepared to deal with a restrictive
environment.  Examples of such restrictions could be
default mount options that disable set-user/group-ID
attributes, disabling block or character-special files on
the medium, or remapping the user and group IDs of files away
from any privileged value.
<note><title>Rationale</title>
<para>
System vendors and local system administrators
want to run applications from removable media, but want the
possibility to control what the application can do.
</para>
</note>
</para>

</SECT2>
 
<SECT2 id=permission-installers>
<TITLE>Installable applications</TITLE>

<PARA>
Where the installation of an application needs additional privileges, it must
clearly document all files and system databases that are modified outside of
those in 
<FILENAME>/opt/<REPLACEABLE>pkg-name</REPLACEABLE></FILENAME>
and <FILENAME>/var/opt/<REPLACEABLE>pkg-name</REPLACEABLE></FILENAME>,
other than those that may be
updated by system logging or auditing activities.


</PARA>

<PARA>
Without this, the local system administrator 
would have to blindly trust a piece of software,
particularly with respect to its security.

<TITLE>Rationale</TITLE>
<PARA>The original intent was to allow an application to contain the binary
