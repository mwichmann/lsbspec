<TITLE>File System Hierarchy</TITLE>
<PARA>
An LSB conforming implementation must adhere to the FHS 2.2.
</PARA>
<PARA>
An LSB conforming application is recommended to follow the
FHS 2.2. If it does not follow the FHS 2.2 it should include
documentation of the differences.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The FHS allows many components or subsystems to be optional. An application
must check for the existence of an optional component before using it, and
should behave in a reasonable manner if the optional component is not
present.
</PARA>
<para>
The FHS requirement to locate the operating system kernel in either
<filename>/</filename> or <filename>/boot</filename> does not apply if
the operating system kernel does not exist as a file in the filesystem.
</para>
<para>
The FHS specifies certain behaviors for a variety of commands if they
are present (for example, ping or python).  However, LSB applications
must not rely on any commands beyond those specified by the LSB.  The
mere existence of a command must not be used as an indication that the
command behaves in any particular way.
</para>
<para>
The following directories or links need not be present:
<filename>/etc/X11</filename> 
<filename>/usr/bin/X11</filename>
<filename>/usr/lib/X11</filename>
<filename>/proc</filename>
</para>

<SECT1 id=dev>
<TITLE><FILENAME>/dev</FILENAME></TITLE>
<PARA>
The following must exist under <FILENAME>/dev</FILENAME>. Other
devices may also exist in <FILENAME>/dev</FILENAME>. Device names may exist
as symbolic links to other device nodes located in <FILENAME>/dev</FILENAME> or
subdirectories of <FILENAME>/dev</FILENAME>.
There is no requirement concerning major/minor number values.
</PARA>
<VARIABLELIST>
<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>
<FILENAME>/dev/null</FILENAME>
</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
All data written to this device is discarded. A read from this device will
return an EOF condition.
</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</VARLISTENTRY>
<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>
<FILENAME>/dev/zero</FILENAME>
</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
This device is a source of zeroed out data. All data written to this device
is discarded. A read from this device will return as many bytes containing
the value zero as was requested.
</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</VARLISTENTRY>
<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>
<FILENAME>/dev/tty</FILENAME>
</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
This device is a synonym for the controlling terminal of a process. Once this
device is opened, all reads and writes will behave as if the actual controlling
terminal device had been opened.
