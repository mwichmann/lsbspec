Packages may not touch the configuration file <FILENAME>/etc/crontab</FILENAME>,
nor may they modify the files in <FILENAME>/var/spool/cron/crontabs</FILENAME>.
</PARA>
<PARA>
If a package wants to install a job that has to be executed via cron,
it shall place a file in one of the
following directories:
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
/etc/cron.daily
/etc/cron.weekly
/etc/cron.monthly
</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>
As these directory names say, the files within them are executed on a
daily, weekly, or monthly basis, respectively.
See below for the rules concerning the names of these files.
</PARA>
<PARA>

If a certain job has to be executed more frequently than daily, the
package shall install a file
<FILENAME>/etc/cron.d/<replaceable>cron-name</replaceable></FILENAME>
tagged as configuration file. This file uses the same syntax as
<FILENAME>/etc/crontab</FILENAME> and is processed by cron automatically.
</PARA>
<PARA>
It is recommended that files installed in any of these directories be
scripts (shell scripts, Perl scripts, etc.) so that they may be
modified by the local system administrator. In addition, they shall be
registered as configuration file.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The scripts in these directories have to check, if all necessary
programs are installed before they try to execute them. Otherwise,
problems will arise when a package was removed (but not purged), since
the configuration files are kept on the system in this situation.

<PARA>
To avoid namespace conflicts in the /etc/cron.* directories, the filenames
used by LSB-compliant packages in /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly, 
/etc/cron.monthly, or /etc/cron.d shall come from a managed namespace.
These filenames may be assigned using one of the following methods:
</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST MARK="bullet">

<MEMBER>status</MEMBER><MEMBER>print the current status of the service</MEMBER>
</SIMPLELIST>
<PARA>
The start, stop, restart, force-reload, and status commands shall be supported
by all init files; the reload and the try-restart options are optional. Other
init script actions may be defined by the init script.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Init files shall ensure that they will behave sensibly if invoked
with start when the service is already running, or with stop when it
isn't, and that they don't kill unfortunately-named user processes. 
The best way to achieve this is to use the init-script functions provided by
<FILENAME>/lib/lsb/init-functions</FILENAME>.
</PARA>
<PARA>
If a service reloads its configuration automatically (as in the case
of cron, for example), the reload option of the init file shall
behave as if the configuration has been reloaded successfully. The restart,
try-restart, reload and force-reload action may be atomic; i.e. if a service
is known not be operational after a restart or reload, the script may return
an error without any further action.
</PARA>
<PARA>
These executable files shall not fail obscurely when the configuration
files remain but the package has been removed, as the default in [the
packaging system] is to leave configuration files on the system after
the package has been removed.  Only when it is executed with the
[purge] option will [the packaging system] remove configuration files.
Therefore, you should include a test statement at the top of the file,
like this:
<SCREEN>
<USERINPUT>test -f program-executed-later-in-file || exit 5</USERINPUT>
</SCREEN>
or take the equivalent action if the init file is not a shell script.
</PARA>

Error and status messages should be printed with the logging

anything else with it.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Since init files may be run manually by a system administrator with
non-standard environment variable values for PATH, USER, LOGNAME,

<PARA>
LSB applications which need to execute script(s) at bootup and/or
shutdown may provide one or more init.d files.  These files are
installed by the install_initd program described below, which copies
it into a standard directory and makes whatever other adjustments
(creation of symlinks, creation of entries in a database, etc.) are
necessary so that the script can be run at boot-time.
<FOOTNOTE><PARA>
This specification does not require, but is designed to allow, the
development of a system which runs boot scripts in parallel.  Hence,
enforced-serialization of scripts is avoided unless it is explicitly
necessary. 
</PARA></FOOTNOTE>
</PARA>

<PARA> 
In the init.d file, information about the shell script shall be
delimited by the lines "### BEGIN INIT INFO" and "### END INIT INFO".
These delimiter lines may containg trailing whitespace, which shall be
ignored.  Inside this block there shall be lines of the form "#
{keyword}: [arg1] [arg2] ...".  (All lines inside this block start
with a hash ('#') character in the first column, so that shell treats
them as comments.)
There shall be exactly one space character between "#" and the
keyword.<footnote><para>More than one space, or a tab character,

The following keywords, with their arguments are

</SCREEN>

<PARA>
Additional keywords may be defined in future LSB specifications.
Distributions may define local extensions by using the prefix
"X-[distribution name]" --- for example, "X-RedHat-foobardecl", or
"X-Debian-xyzzydecl".  
</PARA>

<PARA>
An init.d shell script may declare using the "Required-Start: " header
that it shall not be run until certain boot facilities are provided.
This information is used by the installation tool or the boot-time
boot-script execution facility to assure that init scripts are run in
the correct order.   When an init script is run with a "start" argument, the 
boot facility or facilities specified in the "Provides" header shall be
considered present, and hence init scripts which require those boot facilities
would then be eligble to be run.   When an init script is run with a "stop" 
argument, the boot facilities specified in the "Provides" header are 
considered  no longer  present.  
There are naming conventions for boot facilities and system
facilities, as described in a following section.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Similarly, the "Required-Stop:" header defines which facilities shall
still be available during the shutdown of that service.  Hence, the
init script system should avoid stopping shell scripts which provide
those facilities until this shell script is stopped.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The "Should-Start:" header defines which facilities if present should
be started before this service. This allows for weak dependencies which
do not cause the service to fail if a facility is not available.
But may cause reduced functionality of the service.
Compliant applications should not rely on the existence of this feature.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The "Should-Stop:" header defines which facilities should be still
available during the shutdown of that service.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The "Default-Start" and "Default-Stop" headers define which run levels
should by default run the script with a start or stop argument,
respectively, to start or stop the services controlled by the init script.
<footnote>
<para>
For example, if you want a service to run in runlevels 3, 4, and 5 (only),
specify "Default-Start: 3 4 5" and "Default-Stop: 0 1 2 6".
</para>
</footnote>
</PARA>

<PARA>
The "Short-Description" and "Description" header fields are used to
provide text which describes the actions of the init script.  The
"short_description" shall be a relatively short, pithy description of the
init script, where as the "multiline_description" can be a much longer
piece of text that may span mulitple lines.  In a multiline description,
each continuation line shall begin with a '#' followed by tab character
or a '#' followed by at least two space characters.  The multiline
description is terminated by the first line that does not match this
criteria.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The comment conventions described in this session are only required for
use by LSB-compliant applications; system init scripts as provided by
LSB-compliant run-time environments are <emphasis>not</emphasis>

<SECT1 ID=initsrcinstrm>

<TITLE>Installation and Removal of init.d Files</TITLE>

<PARA>
An init.d file is installed by copying it into /etc/init.d (which may
be a symlink to another location).  This can be done by the package
installer.  During the package's postinstall script, the program
"/usr/lib/lsb/install_initd" configures the distribution's boot
script system to call the package's init.d file at the appropriate
time.
<footnote>
<para>For example, <command>install_initd</command> might create
symbolic links in /etc/rc2.d and other such directories which point to
the files in /etc/init.d (or it might update a database, or some other
mechanism).  The init.d files themselves should already be in
/etc/init.d before running <command>install_initd</command>.</para>
</footnote>
</PARA>

<PARA>
The install_initd program takes a single argument, the pathname to the
/etc/init.d file.  For example:
</PARA>

<SCREEN>
	/usr/lib/lsb/install_initd /etc/init.d/example.com-coffeed
</SCREEN>

<PARA>
The install_initd program shall return an exit status of zero if the
init.d file has been successfully installed or if the the init.d file
was already installed. If the required boot facilities cannot be fulfilled
an exit status of one shall be returned and the init.d file shall not be
installed.
</PARA>

<PARA> 
When a software package is removed, the package's preuninstall script
shall call /usr/lib/lsb/remove_initd and pass the pathname to the
/etc/init.d file.  The package manager is still responsible for removing 
the /etc/init.d file; the remove_initd program is provided in case the
distribution needs to clean up any other modifications in the distribution's
boot script system that might have been made by the install_initd program.
For example:
</PARA>

<SCREEN>
	/usr/lib/lsb/remove_initd /etc/init.d/example.com-coffeed
</SCREEN>

<PARA>
The remove_initd program shall return an exit status of zero if the
init.d file has been successfully removed or if the the init.d file
is not installed. If another init.d file which depends on a boot facility
provided by this init.d file is installed, an exit status of one shall be
returned and the init.d file shall remained installed.
</PARA>

<PARA>
There should be a tool available to the user (e.g., RedHat's chkconfig)
which can be used by the system administrator to easily manipulate at
which init levels a particular init.d script is started or stopped.
This specification currently does not specify such an interface,
however.

<PARA>

The following run levels are specified for use by the "Default-Start:"

linkend="initscrcomconv" endterm="initscriptsShort"/>.  Many LSB
run-time environments commonly use these run level definitions, and in
the absence of other considerations, providers of run-time
environments are strongly encouraged to follow this convention to
provide consistency for system administrators who need to work with
multiple distributions.  However, it is not required that
LSB-compliant run-time environments use these run levels; the
distribution-provided install_initd script may map the run levels
specified below to whatever distribution-specified run levels are most
appropriate.

<TITLE>Script Names</TITLE>

<PARA>
Since the init.d scripts shall live in a single directory, they shall 
come from a single namespace.  Three means of assigning names from
this namespace are available:
</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST MARK="bullet">
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Assigned namespace.  This namespace consists of names which
only use the character set [a-z0-9].  This space is
desirable for scripts which system administrators may
often wish to run manually: e.g., "/etc/init.d/named restart"
In order to avoid conflicts these init.d names shall be reserved
through the Linux Assigned Names and Numbers Authority (LANANA).  
Information about the LANANA may be found at
<ULINK URL="http://www.lanana.org">www.lanana.org</ULINK>.
</PARA>
<PARA>

names which look like this: [hier1]-[hier2]-...-[name],

by the LANANA, or it may be owners' DNS name in lower case, with at
least one '.' (e.g., "debian.org", "staroffice.sun.com").
The LSB provider name assigned by LANANA 
shall only consist of the ASCII characters [a-z0-9].
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
Reserved namespace.  This namespace consists of script names
which begin with the character '_', and is reserved for
distribution use only.  This namespace should be used
for core packages only, and in general use of this
namespace is highly discouraged.  

</PARA></LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>


<PARA>
In general, if a package or some system function is likely to be used
on multiple systems, the package developers or the distribution SHOULD
get a registered name through LANANA, and distributions should strive to
use the same name whenever possible.  For applications which may not
be "core" or may not be commonly installed, the hierarchical namespace
may be more appropriate.  An advantage to the hierarchical namespace
is that there is no need to consult with the LANANA before obtaining an
assigned name.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Short names are highly desirable, since many system
administrators like to use them to manually start and stop services.
Given this, they should be standardized on a per-package basis.  This
is the rationale behind having a LANANA organization to assign these
names.  The LANANA may be called upon to handle other namespace issues,
such as package/prerequisites naming (which is essential to making 
prerequisites to work correctly).
</PARA>

<SECT1 ID=iniscrptfunc>

<TITLE>Init Script Functions</TITLE>

<PARA>
Each LSB-compliant init.d script shall source the file
<filename>/lib/lsb/init-functions</filename>. This file shall cause the
following shell script commands to be defined.  This can be done either by
adding a directory to the PATH variable which defines these commands, or by
defining sh aliases.  While the distribution-provided aliases may
choose to use shell extensions (at the distribution's option), the LSB
init.d files themselves should only depend in shell features as
defined by the LSB.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The <command>start_daemon</command>, <command>killproc</command> and
<command>pidofproc</command> functions shall use this algorithm for determining
the status and the pid(s) of the specified program. They shall read the pidfile
specified or otherwise
<filename>/var/run/<replaceable>basename</replaceable>.pid</filename> and use
the pid(s) herein when determining whether a program is running. The method used
to determine the status is implementation defined, but should allow for
non-binary programs.
<footnote>
<para>
This note is only informative. Commonly used methods check either for the
existence of the <filename>/proc/pid</filename> directory or use
<filename>/proc/pid/exe</filename> and <filename>/proc/pid/cmdline</filename>.
Relying only on <filename>/proc/pid/exe</filename> is discouraged since this
results in a not-running status for daemons that are written in a script
language.
</para>
</footnote>
Compliant implementations may use other mechanisms besides those based on
pidfiles, unless the -p pidfile option has been used. Compliant applications
should not rely on such mechanisms and should
always use a pidfile. When a program is stopped, it should delete its
pidfile. Multiple pid(s) shall be separated by a single space in the pidfile
and in the output of <command>pidofproc</command>.
</PARA>

<SIMPLELIST type=horiz columns=2>
<MEMBER>start_daemon [-f] [-n nicelevel] [-p pidfile] pathname [args]</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>
This runs the specified program as a daemon.
start_daemon shall check if the program is already running
using the algorithm given above. If so, it shall not
start another copy of the daemon unless the <parameter>-f</parameter>
option is given. The <parameter>-n</parameter> option specifies a nice
level. See nice(1).
start_daemon should return the LSB defined exit status codes. It
shall return 0 if the program has been successfully started or
is running and not 0 otherwise.
</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>killproc [-p pidfile] pathname [signal]</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>
This stops the specified program. The program is

signal is specified, using the
<parameter>-<replaceable>signal_name</replaceable></parameter> or
<parameter>-<replaceable>signal_number</replaceable></parameter> syntaxes
as specified by the <command>kill</command> command,
the program is sent that signal.
Otherwise, a SIGTERM followed by a SIGKILL
after some number of seconds shall be sent.
If a program has been terminated, the pidfile should be removed if the
terminated process has not already done so.
Compliant applications may use the basename instead of the 
pathname.
killproc should return the LSB defined exit status codes. If called
without a signal, it shall return 0 if the program has been stopped or
is not running and not 0 otherwise. If a signal is given, it shall return 0
only if the program is running. 
</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>pidofproc [-p pidfile] pathname</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>
This function returns one or more pid(s) for a particular
daemon using the algorithm given above. Only pids of running processes
should be returned.
Compliant applications may use the basename instead of the pathname.
pidofproc should return the LSB defined exit status
codes for "status". It shall return 0 if the program is
running and not 0 otherwise.
