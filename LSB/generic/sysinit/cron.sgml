<TITLE>Cron Jobs</TITLE>
<PARA>
In addition to the individual user <filename>crontab</filename> files specified
by <xref linkend=std.susv3> stored under <filename>/var/spool/cron</filename>,
the process that executes scheduled commands shall also process the following
additional <filename>crontab</filename> files:
<SIMPLELIST type=inline>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/crontab</FILENAME></MEMBER>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.d/*</FILENAME></MEMBER>
</SIMPLELIST>.
The installation of a package shall not modify
the configuration file <FILENAME>/etc/crontab</FILENAME>.
<!--nor shall it modify the files in <FILENAME>/var/spool/cron/crontabs</FILENAME>.-->
</PARA>
<PARA>
If a package wishes to install a job that has to be executed periodically,
it shall place a file in one of the
following directories:
</PARA>
<SIMPLELIST>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.daily</FILENAME></MEMBER>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.weekly</FILENAME></MEMBER>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.monthly</FILENAME></MEMBER>
</SIMPLELIST>
<PARA>
As these directory names suggest, the files within them are executed on a
daily, weekly, or monthly basis, respectively, under the control of an
entry in one of the system <filename>crontab</filename> files.
See below for the rules concerning the names of files in these directories.
</PARA>

<PARA>
It is recommended that files installed in any of these directories be
scripts (e.g. shell scripts, Perl scripts, etc.) so that they may be
modified by the local system administrator. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
The scripts in these directories should check if all necessary
programs are installed before they try to execute them. Otherwise,
problems will arise if a package is removed (but not purged), since
the configuration files are kept on the system in this situation.
</PARA>
<PARA>
If a certain job has to be executed at a different frequency (e.g. more
frequently than daily), the
package shall install a file
<FILENAME>/etc/cron.d/<replaceable>cron-name</replaceable></FILENAME>
tagged as a configuration file. This file uses the same syntax as
<FILENAME>/etc/crontab</FILENAME> and is processed by the system automatically.
</PARA>

<PARA>
To avoid namespace conflicts in the <filename>/etc/cron.*</filename> directories, the filenames
used by LSB-compliant packages in 
<SIMPLELIST type=inline>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.daily</FILENAME></MEMBER>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.weekly</FILENAME></MEMBER>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.monthly</FILENAME></MEMBER>
<MEMBER>or <FILENAME>/etc/cron.d</FILENAME></MEMBER>
</SIMPLELIST>
shall come from a managed namespace.
These filenames may be assigned using one of the following methods:
</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST MARK="bullet">
<LISTITEM><PARA>
	Assigned namespace.  This namespace consists of names which
		only use the character set <literal>[a-z0-9]</literal>.
		In order to avoid conflicts these cron script
		names shall be reserved
		through the Linux Assigned Names and Numbers
		Authority (LANANA).
		Information about the LANANA
		may be found at
		<ULINK URL="http://www.lanana.org">www.lanana.org</ULINK>.
	</PARA>

	<PARA>
		Commonly used names shall be reserved in advance; 
		developers for projects should be encouraged reserve names
		from LANANA, so that each distribution can use the same
		name, and to avoid conflicts with other projects.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
	Hierarchical namespace.  This namespace consists of script
		names of the form: <filename>[hier1]-[hier2]-...-[name]</>,
		where name is again taken from the character set <literal>[a-z0-9],</> 
		and where there may be one or more <filename>[hier-n]</> components.  
		<filename>[hier1]</> may either be an LSB provider name assigned
		by the LANANA, or
		it may be owners' DNS name in lower case, with at
		least one <literal>'.'</>.  
	e.g.  "<literal>debian.org</>", "<literal>staroffice.sun.com</>", etc.
		The LSB provider name assigned by LANANA 
		shall only consist of the ASCII characters <literal>[a-z0-9]</>.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
	Reserved namespace.  This namespace consists of script names
		which begin with the character '<literal>_</>', and is reserved for
		distribution use only.  This namespace should be used
		for core packages only.
</PARA></LISTITEM>
