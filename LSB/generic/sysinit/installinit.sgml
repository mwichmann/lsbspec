<TITLE>Installation and Removal of init.d Files</TITLE>

<PARA>
An init.d file is installed in 
<filename>/etc/init.d</filename> (which may
be a symlink to another location).  This can be done by the package
installer.  See <xref linkend="scrptnames" />.
During the package's postinstall script, the program
"/usr/lib/lsb/install_initd" configures the distribution's boot
script system to call the package's init.d file at the appropriate
time.
<note>
<para>For example, <command>install_initd</command> might create
symbolic links in /etc/rc2.d and other such directories which point to
the files in <filename>/etc/init.d</filename>
(or it might update a database, or some other
mechanism).  The init.d files themselves should already be in
/etc/init.d before running <command>install_initd</command>.</para>
</note>
</PARA>

<PARA>
The install_initd program takes a single argument, the pathname to the
/etc/init.d file.  For example:
</PARA>

<SCREEN>
	/usr/lib/lsb/install_initd /etc/init.d/example.com-coffeed
</SCREEN>

<PARA>
The install_initd program shall return an exit status of zero if the
init.d file has been successfully installed or if the the init.d file
was already installed. If the required boot facilities cannot be fulfilled
an exit status of one shall be returned and the init.d file shall not be
installed.
</PARA>

<PARA> 
When a software package is removed, the package's preuninstall script
shall call /usr/lib/lsb/remove_initd and pass the pathname to the
/etc/init.d file.  The package manager is still responsible for removing 
the /etc/init.d file; the remove_initd program is provided in case the
distribution needs to clean up any other modifications in the distribution's
boot script system that might have been made by the install_initd program.
For example:
</PARA>

<SCREEN>
	/usr/lib/lsb/remove_initd /etc/init.d/example.com-coffeed
</SCREEN>

<PARA>
The remove_initd program shall return an exit status of zero if the
init.d file has been successfully removed or if the the init.d file
is not installed. If another init.d file which depends on a boot facility
provided by this init.d file is installed, an exit status of one shall be
returned and the init.d file shall remained installed.
</PARA>

<PARA>
There should be a tool available to the user (e.g., RedHat's chkconfig)
which can be used by the system administrator to easily manipulate at
which init levels a particular init.d script is started or stopped.
This specification currently does not specify such an interface,
however.
