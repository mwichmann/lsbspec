<TITLE>Installation and Removal of Init Scripts</TITLE>

<PARA>
Conforming applications may install one or more initialization scripts
(or <emphasis>init scripts</emphasis>).
Such scripts are installed in system specific locations by the
<command>lsbinstall</command> command (see <xref linkend="lsbinstall">),
and activated by the <command>install_initd</command> command
(see <xref linkend="installinitd">).
</para>
<para>
During the installer's post-install processing phase the program
<command>/usr/lib/lsb/install_initd</command> must be called to
activate the init script. Activation consists of arranging for
the init script to be called in the correct order on system
run-level changes (including system boot and shutdown), based on
dependencies supplied in the init script (see <XRef linkend="initscrcomconv">).
The <command>install_initd</command> command should be thought of as
a wrapper which hides the implementation details;
how any given implementation arranges for the init
script to be called at the appropriate time is not specified.
</para>
<informalexample>
<blockquote>
<para>
Example: if an init script specified 
"Default-Start: 3 4 5" and "Default-Stop: 0 1 2 6",
<command>install_initd</command> might create
"start" symbolic links with names starting with 'S' in 
<filename>/etc/rc3.d</filename>,
<filename>/etc/rc4.d</filename> and
<filename>/etc/rc5.d</filename>
and "stop" symbolic links with names starting with 'K' in
<filename>/etc/rc0.d</filename>,
<filename>/etc/rc1.d</filename>,
<filename>/etc/rc2.d</filename> and
<filename>/etc/rc6.d</filename>. Such
a scheme would be similar to the System V Init
mechanism, but is by no means the only way
this specification could be implemented.
</para>

<PARA>
The <command>install_initd</command> command takes a single argument, the full pathname
of the installed init script. The init script must already be
installed, typically by means of a call to the <command>lsbinstall</command> command.
The <command>install_initd</command> command will not copy it there, only activate
it once it has been installed in the system specific init script repository.
The <command>lsbinstall</command> command
will print a suitable name for the <command>install_initd</command> utility on its standard
output.
Example:
<informalexample>
<screen>
	PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/lsb
	install_initd $(lsbinstall --type=init example.com-coffeed)
</screen>
</informalexample>
</para>

<PARA>
The <command>install_initd</command> command
shall return an exit status of zero if the
init-script activation was successful or if the init script was
already activated. If the dependencies in the init script 
(see <XRef linkend="initscrcomconv">)  cannot be met, 
an exit status of one shall be returned and the init script shall not be
activated.
</PARA>

<PARA> 
When a software package is removed, <command>/usr/lib/lsb/remove_initd</command>
must be called to deactivate the init script. This must occur
before the init script itself is removed, as the dependency
information in the script may be required for successful completion.
Thus the installer's pre-remove processing phase must call
<command>remove_initd</command>, and pass the full pathname of
the installed init script.
The package installer is still responsible for removing 
the init script.
Example:
<informalexample>
<screen>
	PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/lsb
	# deactivate the init script
	remove_initd $(lsbinstall --check --type=init example.com-coffeed)
	# and remove the init script altogether
	lsbinstall --remove --type=init example.com-coffeed
</screen>
</informalexample>
</PARA>

<PARA>
The <command>remove_initd</command> program shall return an exit status
of zero if the init script has been successfully deactivated or if the
init script is not activated. If another init script which depends
on a boot facility provided by this init script is activated,
an exit status of one shall be returned and the init script shall
remain activated. The installer must fail on such an exit code
so it does not subsequently remove the init script.
</PARA>

<NOTE>
<PARA>
This specification does not describe a mechanism for the system
administrator to manipulate the run levels at which an init script
is started or stopped. There is no assurance that modifying the
comment block for this purpose will have the desired effect.
