<TITLE>Run Levels</TITLE>
<PARA>

The following run levels are specified for use by the "Default-Start:"
and "Default-Stop:" specifiers as defined by the section <xref
linkend="initscrcomconv" endterm="initscriptsShort">.  Many LSB
run-time environments commonly use these run level definitions, and in
the absence of other considerations, providers of run-time
environments are strongly encouraged to follow this convention to
provide consistency for system administrators who need to work with
multiple distributions.  However, it is not required that
LSB-compliant run-time environments use these run levels; the
distribution-provided <command>install_initd</command>
script may map the run levels
specified below to whatever distribution-specified run levels are most
appropriate.
