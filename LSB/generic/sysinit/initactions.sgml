<TITLE>Init Script Actions</TITLE>

<PARA>
Conforming applications which need to execute commands on changes
to the system run level (including boot and shutdown),
may install one or more <FirstTerm>init scripts</FirstTerm>.
Init scripts provided by conforming applications shall accept a single
argument which selects the action:
</PARA>
<SIMPLELIST type=horiz columns=2>
<MEMBER><command>start</command></MEMBER>
<MEMBER>start the service</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>stop</command></MEMBER>
<MEMBER>stop the service</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>restart</command></MEMBER>
<MEMBER>stop and restart the service if the service
is already running, otherwise start the service</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>try-restart</command></MEMBER>
<MEMBER>restart the service if the service
is already running</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>reload</command></MEMBER>
<MEMBER>cause the configuration of the service to be
reloaded without actually stopping and restarting the service</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>force-reload</command></MEMBER>
<MEMBER>cause the configuration to be reloaded
if the service supports this, otherwise restart the service if it is
running</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>status</command></MEMBER>
<MEMBER>print the current status of the service</MEMBER>
</SIMPLELIST>
<PARA>
The <command>start</command>, <command>stop</command>, <command>restart</command>, <command>force-reload</command>, and <command>status</command> actions shall be supported
by all init scripts; the <command>reload</command> and the <command>try-restart</command> actions are optional. Other
init-script actions may be defined by the init script.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Init scripts shall ensure that they will behave sensibly if invoked
with <command>start</command> when the service is already running, or with <command>stop</command> when
not running, and that they do not kill similarly-named user processes. 
The best way to achieve this is to use the init-script functions provided by
<FILENAME>/lib/lsb/init-functions</FILENAME> (see 
<xref linkend="iniscrptfunc">)
</PARA>
<PARA>
If a service reloads its configuration automatically (as in the case
of cron, for example), the <command>reload</command> action of the init
script shall behave as if the configuration was reloaded successfully.
The <command>restart</command>,
<command>try-restart</command>, <command>reload</command> and 
<command>force-reload</command> actions may be atomic; that is if a service
is known not to be operational after a restart or reload, the script may return
an error without any further action.
</PARA>
<note>
<PARA>
This specification does not define the concept of a package
<FirstTerm>upgrade</FirstTerm>. Implementations may do different
things when packages are upgraded, including not replacing an
init script if it is marked as a configuration file,
particularly if the file appears to have been modified since
installation.  In some circumstances, the init script may
not be removed when the package is uninstalled. 
Applications should design their installation
procedure and init scripts to be robust in the face of such
behavior.  In particular, init scripts should not fail obscurely
if run in unexpected circumstances. Testing for the existence
of application binaries before executing them is suggested.
</PARA>
</note>
<PARA>
If the <command>status</command> action is requested,
the init script will return the following 
exit status codes.  

<SIMPLELIST type=horiz columns=2>
<MEMBER><errorcode>0</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>program is running or service is OK</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>1</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>program is dead and /var/run pid file exists</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>2</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>program is dead and /var/lock lock file exists</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>3</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>program is not running</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>4</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>program or service status is unknown</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>5-99</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>reserved for future LSB use</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>100-149</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>reserved for distribution use</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>150-199</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>reserved for application use</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>200-254</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>reserved</MEMBER>
</SIMPLELIST>
</PARA>

<PARA>
For all other init-script actions, the init
script shall return an exit status of zero if the action 
was successful.  Otherwise, the exit status shall
be non-zero, as defined below.  In addition to straightforward
success, the following situations are also to be considered
successful:

<ITEMIZEDLIST MARK="bullet">
<LISTITEM><PARA>
restarting a service (instead of reloading it) with the <command>force-reload</command> argument
</PARA></LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>

</PARA></LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>

</PARA></LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>

</PARA></LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>

</PARA>
<PARA>
In case of an error while processing any init-script action except
for <command>status</command>, the init script shall print an error
message and exit with a non-zero status code:

<SIMPLELIST type=horiz columns=2>
<MEMBER><errorcode>1</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>generic or unspecified error (current practice)</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>2</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>invalid or excess argument(s)</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>3</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>unimplemented feature (for example, "reload")</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>4</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>user had insufficient privilege</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>5</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>program is not installed</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>6</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>program is not configured</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>7</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>program is not running</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>8-99</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>reserved for future LSB use</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>100-149</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>reserved for distribution use</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>150-199</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>reserved for application use</MEMBER>
<MEMBER><errorcode>200-254</errorcode></MEMBER><MEMBER>reserved</MEMBER>
</SIMPLELIST>
</PARA>
<PARA>
Error and status messages should be printed with the logging
functions (see <xref linkend="iniscrptfunc">) 
<function>log_success_msg</function>,
<function>log_failure_msg</function> and 
<function>log_warning_msg</function>.
Scripts may write to
standard error or standard output, but implementations need not
present text written to standard error/output to the user or do
anything else with it.
<NOTE>
<PARA>
Since init scripts may be run manually by a system administrator with
non-standard environment variable values for <EnVar>PATH</EnVar>, 
<EnVar>USER</EnVar>, <EnVar>LOGNAME</EnVar>, etc., 
init scripts should not depend on the values of these environment
variables.  They should set them to some known/default values if they
are needed.
