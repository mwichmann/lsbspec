<TITLE>Script Names</TITLE>

<PARA>
Since init scripts live in a single directory, they must
share a single namespace. To avoid conflicts, four means of
assigning names from this namespace are provided:
</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST MARK="bullet">
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Assigned names.  Such names must be chosen from 
characters in the set <literal>[a-z0-9]</literal>. This category is
desirable for scripts which system administrators may
need to run manually: e.g., <command>/etc/init.d/named restart</command>.
In order to avoid conflicts these names shall be reserved
through the Linux Assigned Names and Numbers Authority (LANANA).  
Information about the LANANA may be found at
<ULINK URL="http://www.lanana.org">www.lanana.org</ULINK>.
</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
Commonly used names. Such names shall be reserved in advance; 
developers for projects are encouraged to reserve names
from LANANA, so that each distribution can use the same
name for the project's init script and avoid conflicts with
other projects.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
Hierarchical names.  Script names in this category take
the form <literal>&lt;hier1&gt;-&lt;hier2&gt;-...-&lt;name&gt;
</literal>, where name is 
chosen from characters in the set <literal>[a-z0-9]</literal>, 
and where there may be one or more <literal>&lt;hier-n&gt;</literal>
components.  
<literal>&lt;hier1&gt;</literal> may either be an LSB provider name assigned
by the LANANA, or it may be the owners' DNS name in lower case, with at
least one <literal>'.'</literal> (e.g., <literal>"debian.org"</literal>, 
or <literal>"staroffice.sun.com"</literal>).
The LSB provider name assigned by LANANA 
shall consist only of characters chosen from the set 
<literal>[a-z0-9]</literal>.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
Reserved names.  Names in this category 
begin with the character <literal>'_'</literal>, and are reserved for
distribution use only.  This namespace should be used
for essential system packages only, and in general use of this
namespace is highly discouraged.  

</PARA></LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>


<NOTE>
<PARA>
In general, if a package or some system function is likely to be used
on multiple systems, the package developers or the distribution should
get a registered name through LANANA, and distributions should strive to
use the same name whenever possible.  For applications which may not
be essential or may not be commonly installed, the hierarchical namespace
may be more appropriate.  An advantage to the hierarchical namespace
is that there is no need to consult with the LANANA before obtaining an
assigned name.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Short names are highly desirable, since system
administrators may need to manually start and stop services.
Given this, they should be standardized on a per-package basis.  This
is the rationale behind having the LANANA organization assign these
names.  The LANANA may be called upon to handle other namespace issues,
such as package/prerequisites naming.
