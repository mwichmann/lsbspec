<TITLE>Facility Names</TITLE>

<PARA>
Boot <FirstTerm>facilities</FirstTerm> are used to indicate dependencies
in init scripts, as defined in <xref linkend="initscrcomconv">.
Facility names that begin with a
dollar sign ('$') are reserved system facility names which
shall be provided by the runtime implementation.
<note><para>Facility names are only recognized in the context of the
init script comment block and are not available in the body of
the init script. In particular, the use of the leading '$' character
does not imply system facility names are subject to shell variable
expansion, since they appear inside comments.
</para></note>
Conforming applications shall not provide facilities that begin with a dollar
sign.  This specification defines the following facility names:
</PARA>

<SIMPLELIST type=horiz columns=2>
<MEMBER><command>$local_fs</command></MEMBER>	
<MEMBER>all local filesystems are mounted</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>$network</command></MEMBER>  	
<MEMBER>basic networking support is available. Example:
a server program could listen on a socket.</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>$named</command></MEMBER>  	
<MEMBER>IP name-to-address translation, using the interfaces
described in this specification, are available to the level
the system normally provides them. Example: if a DNS
query daemon normally provides this facility, then that
daemon has been started. </MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>$portmap</command></MEMBER>
<MEMBER>daemons providing SunRPC/ONCRPC portmapping 
service as defined in RFC 1833
(if present) are running
</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>$remote_fs</command></MEMBER>	
<MEMBER>all remote filesystems are available. In some
configurations, filesystems such as <filename>/usr</filename>
may be remote.  Many
applications that require $local_fs will probably
also require $remote_fs.</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>$syslog</command></MEMBER>
<MEMBER>system logger is operational</MEMBER>

<MEMBER><command>$time</command></MEMBER>  	
<MEMBER>the system time has been set,
for example by using a network-based time program such as 
<command>ntp</command> or 
<command>rdate</command>, or 
via the hardware Real Time Clock.
</MEMBER>

</SIMPLELIST>

<PARA>
Other (non-system) facilities may be defined by other conforming applications.
These facilities shall be named using the same conventions defined for
naming init scripts (see <XRef linkend="scrptnames">).
Commonly, the facility provided by a conforming init script will have
the same name as the name assigned to the init script.
