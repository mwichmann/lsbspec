<TITLE>Facility Names</TITLE>

<PARA>
Boot <FirstTerm>facilities</FirstTerm> are used to indicate dependencies
in initialization scripts, as defined in <xref linkend="initscrcomconv">. 
Facility names
are assigned to scripts by the <command>Provides:</command> keyword.
Facility names that begin with a
dollar sign (<literal>'$'</literal>) are reserved system facility names.
<note><para>Facility names are only recognized in the context of the
init script comment block and are not available in the body of
the init script. In particular, the use of the leading '$' character
does not imply system facility names are subject to shell variable
expansion, since they appear inside comments.
</para></note>
Conforming applications shall not provide facilities that begin with a dollar
sign.  Implementations shall provide the following facility names:

<PARA>
Other (non-system) facilities may be defined by other conforming applications.
These facilities shall be named using the same conventions defined for
naming init scripts (see <XRef linkend="scrptnames">).
Commonly, the facility provided by a conforming init script will have
the same name as the name assigned to the init script.
