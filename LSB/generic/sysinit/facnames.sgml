<TITLE>Facility names</TITLE>

<PARA>
Boot facilities are used to indicate dependencies in init scripts, as
defined in a previous section.  Facility names that begin with a
dollar sign ('$') are system facility names, defined by the LSB, and
MUST be provided by distributions.  LSB applications must not provide
system facilities.  This document defines the following system
facility names:
</PARA>

<SIMPLELIST type=horiz columns=2>
<MEMBER>$local_fs</MEMBER>	
<MEMBER>all local filesystems are mounted</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$network</MEMBER>  	
<MEMBER>low level networking (ethernet card; may
imply PCMCIA running)</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$named</MEMBER>  	
<MEMBER>Daemons which may provide hostname resolution (if present) are
running</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$remote_fs</MEMBER>	
<MEMBER>all remote filesystems are mounted (note
in some cases /usr may be remote.  Most
applications that care will probably require
both $local_fs and $remote_fs)</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$syslog</MEMBER>
<MEMBER>system logger is operational</MEMBER>

</SIMPLELIST>

<PARA>
Other (non-system) facilities may be defined by other LSB applications.
These facilities shall be named using the same conventions defined for
naming init.d script names.  Commonly, the facility provided by
an LSB application init.d script will have the same name as the name 
assigned  to the init.d script.
