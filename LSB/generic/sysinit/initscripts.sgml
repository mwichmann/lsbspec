<TITLE>Comment conventions for init scripts</TITLE>

<PARA>
Packages that need to execute a script at bootup and/or shutdown will
provide an init.d file.  This file is installed by the install_initd
program described below, which copies it into a standard directory and
makes whatever other adjustments (creation of symlinks, creation of
entries in a database, etc.) are necessary so that the script can be run
at boot-time.
<FOOTNOTE><PARA>
This specification does not require, but is designed to allow, the
development of a system which runs boot scripts in parallel.  Hence,
enforced serialization of scripts are avoided unless they are explicitly
necessary. 
</PARA></FOOTNOTE>
</PARA>

<PARA> 
In the init.d file, information about the shell script shall be
delimited by the lines "### BEGIN INIT INFO" and "### END INIT INFO".
These delimiter lines may containg trailing whitespace, which shall be
ignored.  Inside this block there shall be lines of the form "#
{keyword}: [arg1] [arg2] ...".  (All lines inside this block start
with a hash ('#') character in the first column, so that shell treats
them as comments.)  The following keywords, with their arguments are
defined in this specification:
</PARA>

<SCREEN>
	# Provides: boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
	# Required-Start: boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
	# Required-Stop: boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
	# Default-Start: run_level_1 [ run_level_2 ...]
	# Default-Stop: run_level_1 [ run_level_2 ...]
	# Description: multiline_description
</SCREEN>

<PARA>
Additional keywords may be defined in future LSB specifications.
Distributions may define local extensions by using the prefix
"X-[distribution name]" --- for example, "X-RedHat-foobardecl", or
"X-Debian-xyzzydecl".  
</PARA>

<PARA>
An init.d shell script may declare using the "Required-Start: " header
that it must not be run until certain boot facilities are provided.
This information is used by the installation tool or the boot-time
boot-script execution facility to assure that init scripts are run in
the correct order.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Similarly, the "Required-Stop:" header defines which facilities must
still be available during the shutdown of that service.  Hence, the
initscript system should avoid stopping shell scripts which provide
those facilities until this shell script is stopped.
</PARA>

<PARA>
In a multiline description, each continuation line must begin with a
'#' followed by tab character or a '#' followed by at least two space
characters.  The multiline description is terminated by the first line
that does not match this criteria.
</PARA>
