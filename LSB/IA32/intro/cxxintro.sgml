<PARA>
The Linux Standard Base (LSB) defines a system interface for compiled
applications and a minimal environment for support of installation scripts.
Its purpose is to enable a uniform industry standard environment for
high-volume applications conforming to the LSB.
</PARA>

<PARA>
These specifications are composed of two basic parts: A common specification
("LSB-generic" or "generic LSB"), &ISOSTD-1;, describing those parts of the interface that
remain constant across all implementations of the LSB, and an
architecture-specific part ("LSB-arch") describing the
parts of the interface that vary by processor architecture.
Together, the LSB-generic and the relevant
architecture-specific part of &ISOSTD; for a single hardware architecture provide a
complete interface specification for compiled application programs on systems
that share a common hardware architecture.
</PARA>

<PARA>
&ISOSTD-1, the LSB-generic document, should be used in conjunction with an
architecture-specific part. Whenever a section of the LSB-generic
specification
is supplemented by architecture-specific information, the LSB-generic
document
includes a reference to the architecture part. Architecture-specific parts of &ISOSTD;
may also contain additional information that is not referenced in the
LSB-generic document.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The LSB contains both a set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs)
and Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs). APIs may appear in the
source code of portable applications, while the compiled binary of that
application may use the larger set of ABIs. A conforming implementation
provides all of the ABIs listed here. The compilation system may
replace (e.g. by macro definition) certain APIs with calls to one or
more of the underlying binary interfaces, and may insert calls to binary
interfaces as needed.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The LSB is primarily a binary interface
definition. Not all of the source level APIs available to applications
may be contained in this specification.
</PARA>

<SECT1 ID="cxxscope">
<TITLE>Module Specific Scope</TITLE>
<PARA>
This is the C++ module of the Linux Standards Base (LSB).
This module supplements the core interfaces by providing
system interfaces, libraries,
and a runtime environment for applications built using the
C++ programming language. These interfaces provide low-level
support for the core constructs of the language, and
implement the standard base C++ libraries.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Interfaces described in this module are presented in terms
of C++; the binary interfaces will use encoded or mangled
versions of the names.

<PARA>
The specifications listed below are referenced in whole or in part by
this module of
the Linux Standard Base.  In this specification, where only a particular section
of one of these references is identified, then the normative reference is to
that section alone, and the rest of the referenced document is informative.
