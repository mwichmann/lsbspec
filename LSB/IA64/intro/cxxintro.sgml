<PARA>
The LSB defines a binary interface for application programs that are compiled
and packaged for LSB-conforming implementations on many different hardware
architectures. Since a binary specification shall include information specific
to the computer processor architecture for which it is intended, it is not
possible for a single document to specify the interface for all possible
LSB-conforming implementations. Therefore, the LSB is a family of
specifications, rather than a single one.
</PARA>

<PARA>
This document should be used in conjunction with the documents it references.
This document enumerates the system components it includes, but descriptions of
those components may be included entirely or partly in this document, partly in
other documents, or entirely in other reference documents. For example, the
section that describes system service routines includes a list of the system
routines supported in this interface, formal declarations of the data
structures they use that are visible to applications, and a pointer to the
underlying referenced specification for information about the syntax and
semantics of each call. Only those routines not described in standards
referenced by this document, or extensions to those standards, are described in
the detail. Information referenced in this way is as much a part of this
document as is the information explicitly included here.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The specification carries a version number of either the form
<literal>x.y</literal> or <literal>x.y.z</literal>.
This version number carries the following meaning:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
The first number (<literal>x</literal>) is the major version number.
All versions with the same major version number should share
binary compatibility. Any addition or deletion of a new library
results in a new version number.  Interfaces marked as
<literal>deprecated</literal> may be removed from the
specification at a major version change.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The second number (<literal>y</literal>) is the minor version number.
Individual interfaces may be added if all certified implementations
already had that (previously undocumented) interface. Interfaces may be
marked as <literal>deprecated</literal> at a minor version change.
Other minor changes may be permitted at the discretion of the LSB workgroup.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The third number (<literal>z</literal>), if present, is the editorial level. Only
editorial changes should be included in such versions.

<TITLE>General</TITLE>
<PARA>
The Linux Standard Base (LSB) defines a system interface for compiled
applications and a minimal environment for support of installation scripts.
Its purpose is to enable a uniform industry standard environment for
high-volume applications conforming to the LSB.
</PARA>

<PARA>
These specifications are composed of two basic parts: A common specification
("LSB-generic") describing those parts of the interface that
remain constant across all implementations of the LSB, and an
architecture-specific specification ("LSB-arch") describing the
parts of the interface that vary by processor architecture.
Together, the LSB-generic and the
architecture-specific supplement for a single hardware architecture provide a
complete interface specification for compiled application programs on systems
that share a common hardware architecture.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The LSB-generic document shall be used in conjunction with an
architecture-specific supplement. Whenever a section of the LSB-generic
specification
shall be supplemented by architecture-specific information, the LSB-generic
document
includes a reference to the architecture supplement. Architecture supplements
may also contain additional information that is not referenced in the
LSB-generic document.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The LSB contains both a set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs)
and Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs). APIs may appear in the
source code of portable applications, while the compiled binary of that
application may use the larger set of ABIs. A conforming implementation
shall provide all of the ABIs listed here. The compilation system may
replace (e.g. by macro definition) certain APIs with calls to one or
more of the underlying binary interfaces, and may insert calls to binary
interfaces as needed.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The LSB is primarily a binary interface
definition. Not all of the source level APIs available to applications
may be contained in this specification.
</PARA>
</SECT1>

<SECT1 ID="cxxscope">
<TITLE>Module Specific Scope</TITLE>
<PARA>
This is the C++ module of the Linux Standards Base (LSB).
This module supplements the core interfaces by providing
system interfaces, libraries,
and a runtime environment for applications built using the
C++ programming language. These interfaces provide low-level
support for the core constructs of the language, and
implement the standard base C++ libraries.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Interfaces described in this module are presented in terms
of C++; the binary interfaces will use encoded or mangled
versions of the names.

<PARA>
The specifications listed below are referenced in whole or in part by
this module of
the Linux Standard Base.  In this specification, where only a particular section
of one of these references is identified, then the normative reference is to
that section alone, and the rest of the referenced document is informative.
