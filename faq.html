<A NAME="cntrb"><H2>1. How-To Contribute...</H2></A>
The Linux Standard Base's (LSB) written specification is developed by a set
of volunteers.  Some have more time and/or experience than others; therefore, 
there is a core team for continuity and stability.

<a name="pckg2.1"><h3>2.1 I like to use packager &lt;foo&gt; instead of RPM!</h3></a>
The LSB does not specify the program `rpm' nor the RPM database, but
instead the RPM file format. How the LSB compliant packages are
processed by the distributions during installation is up to
them. Using conversion programs such as alien it is possible to
convert the format to .tgz or .deb files and use other package
management programs other than rpm. This arrangement was agreed up on
by the major distributions including deb based ones (eg Debian, Storm,
Corel) as well as RPM based ones (Red Hat, SuSE, TurboLinux, Caldera,
Mandrake).
<p>
<a name="pckg2.2"><h3>2.2 Why not use format &lt;X&gt; instead of the RPM format?</h3></a>

RPM is the defacto standard on Linux and all modern distributions can
support RPM packages using the alien program.
<p>

<a name="pckg2.3"><h3>2.3 But some features of the RPM format can't be done by format &lt;X&gt;!</h3></a>

For compatibility reasons with Debian dpkg systems using alien, we
will also sharply restrict what kind of trigger scripts can be
included with such RPM's. Trigger scripts are scripts that can run
when another (arbitrary) package is installed or removed.<p>

<a name="pckg2.4"><h3>2.4 What about this new RPM/deb merged packaging format I've heard about?</h3></a>

The use of the RPM format is intended to be an interim measure. The
work on this new format has not been completed yet. It will probably
be adopted by the LSB in the future when it is ready.<p>

<a name="pckg2.5"><h3>2.5  I don't like RPMs because I've tried using an RPM for distribution &lt;a&gt; and it didn't work on distribution &lt;b&gt;</h3></a>

This is a problem associated with the way that a package was created
and not the actual packaging format. These problems are due to
differences between different distributions such as directory layout
and ABI differences between versions of libraries installed. Parts of
the LSB specification such as the File Hierarchy Standard (FHS) and
the specification of various ABIs attempt to remove these problems.<p>

<a name="pckg2.6"><h3>2.6 Why aren't categories of packages (such as
System, Development, Networking) defined in the LSB
specification?</h3></a>

This is outside the scope of the LSB. It does not affect the ability
for packages to install and run on different distributions.<p>

<a name="pckg2.7"><h3>2.7 What dependencies can be specified in an LSB compliant package?</h3></a>

The package should only be dependent on the base LSB system (eg
LSB-2.0) being present [and possibly other LSB compliant packages?]<p>

<a name="pckg2.8"><h3>2.8 As an ISV do I have to supply my
application in RPM format to be LSB compliant?</h3></a>

No. ISV's are not obligated to ship their software in the RPM format.
They can use any other format, or even write their own custom
installer. However using the LSB recommended format will probably make
life easier for their users.<p>
