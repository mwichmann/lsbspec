<TITLE>Desktop Base Directory</TITLE>

<para>
Various specifications specify files and file formats. The
<xref linkend="std.XdgBasedir"> 
defines where these files should be looked for by defining one or more
base directories relative to which files should be located.
</para>

<SECT1 id=xdg-entry>
<TITLE>Desktop Entries</TITLE>
<para>
The <xref linkend="std.XdgDesktop"> describes desktop entries: files
describing information about an application such as the name, icon,
and description. These files are used for application launchers and for
creating menus of applications that can be launched.

<SECT1 id=xdg-menu>
<TITLE>Desktop Menu Specification</TITLE>
<para>
The <xref linkend="std.XdgMenu"> defines how to construct a user-visible

third-party software to add menu items that work for all desktops,
and allows system administrators to edit menus in a way that affects
all desktops.

<SECT1 id=xdg-iconthemes>
<TITLE>Icon Theme Specification</TITLE>
<para>
The <xref linkend="std.XdgIcon"> defines Icon Themes - a set of icons that
share a common look and feel. It defines the required directory layout,
the format of the icon theme description file and the icon data files,

<title>Xdg-utils</title>
<para>
Xdg-utils is a set of command line utilities that assist applications with
a variety of desktop integration tasks. Some of the utilities focus on
tasks commonly required during the installation of a desktop application.
The remainder focus on integration with the desktop environment
while the application is running. 
</para>
<para>
These utilities operate as described at <xref linkend="std.xdg.utils">

<title>Xdg-utils Commands</title>

<!-- Start of text generated from database -->
<para>
An LSB conforming implementation shall provide the
commands and utilities as described in <xref linkend="xdg-cmds">, with at least the behavior
described as mandatory in the referenced underlying
specification, with the following exceptions:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
If any operand (except one which follows <option>--</option>) starts with a
hyphen, the behavior is unspecified.
<note><title>Rationale (Informative)</title>
<para>Applications should place options before operands, or use
<option>--</option>, as needed.  This text is needed because,
by default, GNU option parsing
differs from POSIX, unless the environment variable 
<envar>POSIXLY_CORRECT</envar>
is set.  For example, <command>ls . -a</command> in GNU
<command>ls</command> means to list the current directory, showing all
files (that is, <option>"."</option> is an operand and <option>-a</option> is an
option).  In POSIX, <option>"."</option> and <option>-a</option> are both operands,
and the command means to list the current directory, and also the file
named <filename>-a</filename>.  Suggesting that applications rely on the
setting of the <envar>POSIXLY_CORRECT</envar> environment variable,
or try to set it, seems worse than just asking the applications to invoke
commands in ways which work with either the POSIX or GNU behaviors.</para>
