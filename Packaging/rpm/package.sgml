The distribution itself may use a different packaging format for its

<TITLE>Package Script Constraints</TITLE>
<PARA>
Scripts used as part of the package install and uninstall may only use
commands and interfaces that are specified by the LSB. All other commands are
not guaranteed to be present, or behave in expected ways.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Packages may not use RPM triggers.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Packages may not depend on the order in which scripts are executed
(pre-install, pre-uninstall, &amp;c), when doing an upgrade.

<TITLE>Package Tools</TITLE>
<PARA>
The LSB does not specify the interface to the tools used to manipulate LSB
format packages. Each conforming distribution will provide documentation
for installing LSB format packages.

<SECT1 ID=pkgnameconv>
<TITLE>Package Naming</TITLE>
<PARA>
Because there is no consistent packaging naming amongst the various
Linux distributions, it is necessary for LSB complaint applications to
adhere the following rules to avoid conflicts with packages provided by 
the distributions.
</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST MARK="bullet">
<LISTITEM> <PARA>
All LSB package names must begin with the prefix "lsb-" to avoid conflicting
with existing packages used by Linux distributions.
</PARA>
</LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
If the package name contains only one hyphen (including the one in the 
"lsb-" prefix) then the package name must be assigned by the 
<ULINK URL="http://www.lanana.org">Linux Assigned Names and 
Numbers Authority</ULINK> (LANANA), which shall maintain a
registry of LSB names.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
If the package name contains more than one hyphen (i.e., 
"lsb-www.redhat.com-redhat-database" or "lsb-gnome-gnumeric"), then 
the portion of the package name between first and second hyphens must 
either be an LSB provider name assigned
by the LANANA, or it may be owners' DNS name in lower case, with at
least one '.'.  I.e., "debian.org", "staroffice.sun.com", etc.
The LSB provider name assigned by LANANA 
must only consist of the ASCII characters [a-z0-9].

<SECT1>
<TITLE>Package Dependencies</TITLE>
<PARA>
Packages must depend on a dependency "lsb".  They may not depend on
other system-provided dependencies.  If a package includes "Provides"
it must only provide a virtual package name which is registered to
that application.
