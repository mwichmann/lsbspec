<TITLE>Package Format</TITLE>
<PARA>

Currently the LSB does not officially specify a package format; however,
the recommended package format is RPM (Version 3) with some restrictions 
listed below.
RPM is the defacto standard on Linux and supported either
directly, or indirectly by the widest number of distributions. The
intent is to in the future replace this format with a new format
currently being developed.

format packages. Each conforming distribution will provide documentation
for installing LSB format packages.

<TITLE>Package Naming Conventions</TITLE>
<PARA>
Packages should follow these rules for creating their names. This will enable
the use of package dependencies by LSB conforming packages.

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Package Dependencies</TITLE>
<PARA>
Packages must depend on a dependency "lsb".  They may not depend on
other system-provided dependencies.  If a package includes "Provides"
it must only provide a virtual package name which is registered to
that application.
