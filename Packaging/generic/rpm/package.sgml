<TITLE>Package Format</TITLE>
<PARA>
Applications should be provided in the RPM packaging format
as defined in the
<ulink url="http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-file-format-rpm-file-format.html">
appendix</ulink> of the 1997 edition of
<ulink url="http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/">
Maximum RPM
</ulink>,
with some restrictions listed below.
<FOOTNOTE ID="pkg-1">
<PARA>
Some versions of RPM may produce packages which contain extensions or 
modifications to the RPM package format beyond what has been documented 
in the appendix of the Maximum RPM book.  An LSB-conformant package must 
not contain any of these extensions, in order to assure interoperability
with the largest number of versions of RPM and packaging systems which
understand how to import RPM format packages.
</PARA>
</FOOTNOTE>
</PARA>
<PARA>
Distributions must provide a mechanism for installing applications in
this packaging format with some restrictions listed
below.
<FOOTNOTE ID="pkg-2">
<PARA>
The distribution itself may use a different packaging format for its
own packages, and of course it may use any available mechanism for 
installing the LSB-conformant packages.

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Package Script Restrictions</TITLE>
<PARA>
Scripts used as part of the package install and uninstall may only use
commands and interfaces that are specified by the LSB. All other commands are
not guaranteed to be present, or to behave in expected ways.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Packages may not use RPM triggers.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Packages may not depend on the order in which scripts are executed
(pre-install, pre-uninstall, &amp;c), when doing an upgrade.

<SECT1 ID=pkgtools>
<TITLE>Package Tools</TITLE>
<PARA>
The LSB does not specify the interface to the tools used to manipulate 
LSB-conformant packages. Each conforming distribution will provide 
documentation for installing LSB packages.
</PARA>

<SECT1 ID=pkgnameconv>
<TITLE>Package Naming</TITLE>
<PARA>
Because there is no consistent packaging naming among the various
Linux distributions, it is necessary for LSB-conformant packages to
adhere the following naming rules to avoid conflicts with packages 
provided by the distributions.
</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST MARK="bullet">
<LISTITEM> <PARA>
All LSB package names must begin with the prefix "lsb-" to avoid conflicting
with existing packages used by Linux distributions.
</PARA>
</LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
If the package name contains only one hyphen (including the one in the 
"lsb-" prefix) then the package name must be assigned by the 
<ULINK URL="http://www.lanana.org">Linux Assigned Names and 
Numbers Authority</ULINK> (LANANA), which shall maintain a
registry of LSB names.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
If the package name contains more than one hyphen (i.e., 
"lsb-www.redhat.com-redhat-database", "lsb-gnome-gnumeric"), then 
the portion of the package name between first and second hyphens must 
either be an LSB provider name assigned by the LANANA, or it may be 
one of the owners' fully-qualified domain name in lower case (e.g., 
"debian.org", "staroffice.sun.com"). The LSB provider name assigned 
by LANANA must only consist of the ASCII characters [a-z0-9].
</PARA></LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>

</SECT1>

<SECT1 ID=pkgdepend>
<TITLE>Package Dependencies</TITLE>
<PARA>
Packages must depend on a dependency "lsb".  They may not depend on
other system-provided dependencies.  They must not depend on
non-system-provided dependencies unless the dependencies are fulfilled
by packages which are part of the same application.
If a package includes "Provides"
it must only provide a virtual package name which is registered to
that application.
