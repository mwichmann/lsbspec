<TITLE>Package Dependencies</TITLE>
<PARA>
Packages shall have a dependency that indicates which LSB modules are
required.
LSB module descriptions are dash seperated tuples containing the name 'lsb',
the module name, and the architecture name. The following dependencies may be
used.
<VARIABLELIST>
<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>lsb-core-<replaceable>arch</replaceable></TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
This dependency is used to indicate that the application is dependent
on features contained in the LSB-Core specification.
</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</VARLISTENTRY>
<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>lsb-core-noarch</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
This dependency is used to indicate that the application is dependent
on features contained in the LSB-Core specification and that the package 
does not contain any architecture specific files.
</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</VARLISTENTRY>
</VARIABLELIST>
</PARA>
<PARA>
Packages shall not depend on other system-provided dependencies.  They
shall not depend on non-system-provided dependencies unless those dependencies
are fulfilled by packages which are part of the same application. 
A package may only provide a virtual package name
which is registered to that application.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Other modules in the LSB may supplement this list. The architecture
specific dependencies are described in the relevant architecture
specific LSB.
