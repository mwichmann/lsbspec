<PARA>
Packages shall have a dependency that indicates which LSB modules are
required.
LSB module descriptions are dash seperated tuples containing the name 'lsb',
the module name, and the architecture name. The following dependencies may be
used.
<VARIABLELIST>
<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>lsb-core-<replaceable>arch</replaceable></TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
This dependency is used to indicate that the application is dependent

</VARLISTENTRY>
<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>lsb-core-noarch</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>
This dependency is used to indicate that the application is dependent
on features contained in the LSB-Core specification and that the package 
does not contain any architecture specific files.

<PARA>
These dependencies shall have a version of &packaging-depver;.

Packages shall not depend on other system-provided dependencies.  They
shall not depend on non-system-provided dependencies unless 
the package provider also makes available the LSB conforming
packages needed to satisfy such dependencies.
