<TITLE>Facility names</TITLE>

<PARA>
Boot facilities are used to indicate dependencies in init scripts, as
defined in a previous section.  Facility names that begin with a
dollar sign ('$') are system facility names, defined by the LSB, and
MUST be provided by distributions.
<footnote><para>The dollar sign does not indicate variable expansion
as in many Linux utilities.  Starting a facility name with a dollar
sign is merely a way of dividing the namespace between the system and
applications.
</para></footnote>
LSB applications must not provide facilities that begin with a dollar
sign.  This document defines the following facility names:

<SIMPLELIST type=horiz columns=2>
<MEMBER>$local_fs</MEMBER>	
<MEMBER>all local filesystems are mounted</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$network</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$remote_fs</MEMBER>	
<MEMBER>all remote filesystems are mounted<FOOTNOTE><PARA>In some
LSB run-time environments, filesystems such as /usr may be remote.  Many
applications that require $local_fs will probably require
also require $remote_fs</PARA></FOOTNOTE>.</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$syslog</MEMBER>
<MEMBER>system logger is operational</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$time</MEMBER>  	
<MEMBER>the system time has been set 
<FOOTNOTE><PARA>
i.e., using a network-based time program such as ntp or rdate, or 
via the hardware Real Time Clock
</PARA></FOOTNOTE>
</MEMBER>

</SIMPLELIST>

<PARA>
Other (non-system) facilities may be defined by other LSB applications.
These facilities shall be named using the same conventions defined for
naming init.d script names.  Commonly, the facility provided by
an LSB application init.d script will have the same name as the name 
assigned  to the init.d script.
