<h1>
Building the LSB</h1>
First, check out the site using CVS:
<pre><tt>&nbsp; cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.lsb.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lsb login
&nbsp; cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.lsb.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lsb co spec</tt></pre>
Make sure you have a set of DocBook tools. <p>

If you have:

<ul>

<li> Red Hat Linux 6.2, installing the following packages
included in the 6.2 distribution should suffice: docbook, psgml, jade,
sgml-common, sgml-tools, jadetex, and stylesheets; otherwise, try
running <b><i>installsgml.sh</i></b> found in your checked out copy of
the LSB's spec directory. For older versions of Red Hat, see
http://sources.redhat.com/docbook-tools/. <p>

<li>Red Hat Linux 7.x is similar; install the packages whose names
start with "docbook" and everything they depend on.  Then a command
like
<pre>
make DB2HTML="docbook2html -o gLSB -p 'jade -V %use-id-as-filename%'"
</pre>
should work.
</li>

<li>For Debian systems the specification is known to build well with
the following versions of packages: <tt>sgmltools (3.0.2.3)</tt>,
<tt>docbook (4.1)</tt>, and <tt>jadetex (3.7)</tt>. Executing:
 
<pre><tt>apt-get install docbook jadetex sgmltools-lite</pre></tt>

will in most cases setup the correct environment.<p>


<li>For SuSE Linux 7.1, you'll have to install the following packages:
<tt>jade</tt>, <tt>docbkdsl</tt> and <tt>docbktls</tt> (all from package
series <tt>sgml</tt>). If you want to generate PostScript output too,
please install the packages <tt>tetex</tt> and <tt>jadetex</tt> as well.<p>


<li>For other distributions, anyone want to contribute a recipe?</li>

</ul>

<p>
<p>The top level <tt>makefile</tt> can be used to rebuild the document.
The default target will build both HTML and RTF format ofthe document.
There are targets available for building each one individually as well
as plain text and single page html versions.

<p>There are also targets for regenerating portions of the document from
the database, but this is normally not needed, and the setup to perform
this step is much more complicated. Not quite up to date instruction can
be found in <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/spec/README.SQL?cvsroot=lsb">spec/README.SQL</a>.
<p>Now, where to get started? baselib/select.sgml is a simple example of
the documentation for one function, which may be instructive. If you don't
know DocBook, you'll probably need to refer to the
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/">online
DocBook documentation</a>. Or the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/docbook/">O'Reilly
DocBook</a> book. Other than that, just walk through the makefiles until
you figure things out I guess. Feel free to ask on the <a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/lists.html">LSB
mailing lists</a> if you are having trouble finding things.
<p>The "spec" subdirectory is both in CVS and generated by the makefiles,
and the makefiles do some moving it around in a way that doesn't completely
work. One workaround is to manually delete "D/spec////" from CVS/Entries
(until we can come up with a cleaner way to handle the whole thing).
<p>Now, what to do with any enhancements you make? Well, the way to get
started is to check the tree out anonymously (as noted above), and send
your diffs to the mailing list. But if you have already done that for a
while and someone thinks you should have an account see the instructions
on our <a href="sourceforge.html">sourceforge page</a>.
