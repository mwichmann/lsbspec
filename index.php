<H1>About the Specification</H1>
The LSB Specification is written in OASIS V4.1 Docbook SGML.&nbsp; You
can&nbsp; <a href="http://gforge.freestandards.org/scm/?group_id=5">checkout
a copy</a> of the Docbook source from the LSB project on SourceForge.Net.
Portions of the document are produced from a <a href="db.shtml">database</a>
that was designed and is maintained by the LSB. In the spec tree there
is a <i>build.html </i>file which describes <a href="build.html">how to
build the specification</a> from the CVS Docbook source.
<H1><a NAME="contribute"></a>How to Contribute</H1>
The LSB Specification is a community effort.&nbsp; There are several ways
for you to contribute.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first way for you to contribute
is to read and review the specification, then email your questions and
comments to the <i>lsb-spec</i> <a href="../lists.html">email list</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The second way is to send your corrections for the spec in context diff
format to the <i>lsb-spec</i> email list.&nbsp;&nbsp; The third way is
to <a href="http://gforge.freestandards.org.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=5">find
an LSB developer</a>, then send him/her your corrections.&nbsp; The final
way to contribute to the LSB written specification is to become an LSB
developer to make CVS changes directly to the tree with your and other's
submitted changes. Here is a list of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?group_id=1107&set=custom&group_project_id=3049&_assigned_to=100&_status=1&SUBMIT=Browse">things
