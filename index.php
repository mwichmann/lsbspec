<p>
The LSB Specification is written in OASIS V4.1 Docbook SGML.&nbsp; You
can&nbsp; <a href="http://gforge.freestandards.org/scm/?group_id=5">checkout
a copy</a> of the Docbook source from the LSB project on
gforge.freestandards.org.
Portions of the document are produced from a <a href="db.shtml">database</a>
that was designed and is maintained by the LSB. In the spec tree there
is a <i>build.html </i>file which describes <a href="build.html">how to
build the specification</a> from the CVS Docbook source.</p>
