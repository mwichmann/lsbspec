<p>
The LSB specification is made up of several components, known
as modules.  The base specification consists the of Core,
Graphics and CXX (C++) modules.
The specification is further extended with the Desktop set.
Each module might be subdivided into a common document plus
architecture-specific documents (in some cases the
subdivision is not needed). A complete binary standard for
a particular processor architecture consists of the set of
necessary common documents plus the matching set of
architecture-specific documents.
</p>
<p>
Some of the components are further subdivided into functional
units.  For convenience, the functional units may be used for
review purposes. For example, if your interest is in packaging,
you may wish to review the packaging "individual specification"
by itself.  The individual specifications (sometimes called
"books") are <b>not</b> released by the LSB project on a standalone
basis, only rolled up into the specification modules.
