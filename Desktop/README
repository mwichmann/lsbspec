This is a dummy module specification.

LSB-Desktop consists of multiple constituent modules, subject to change
over time.  For LSB 5.0:

Graphics, Toolkit_Gtk, Toolkit_Qt, Toolkit_Independent, Multimedia

Each of these modules has a source directory in this project.  When the
unified bookset is built, however, it has to reference some unified
items - introductory and appendix material - which can't easily be
reconstitued from the individual module directories.  This directory
exists only to house that material, and does not otherwise contain
specification material.
