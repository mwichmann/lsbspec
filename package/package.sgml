<TITLE>Package Format</TITLE>
<PARA>

The recommended package format is RPM (Version 3) with some
restrictions listed below.

<NOTE>
<PARA>
Rationale: RPM is the defacto standard on Linux and supported either
directly, or indirectly by the widest number of distributions. The
intent is to in the future replace this format with a new format
currently being developed.
</PARA>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Package Format Description</TITLE>
<PARA>
A formal description of the package file format needs to be put here.
</PARA>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Package Script Constraints</TITLE>
<PARA>
Scripts used as part of the package install and uninstall may only use
commands and interfaces that are specified by the LSB. All other commands are
not guaranteed to be present, or behave in expected ways.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Packages may not use RPM triggers.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Packages may not depend on the order in which scripts are executed
(pre-install, post-install, &amp;c), when doing an update.
</PARA>
</SECT2>

</SECT1>

<SECT1>
<TITLE>Package Tools</TITLE>
<PARA>
The LSB does not specify the interface to the tools used to manipulate LSB
format packages. Each conforming distribution will provide documentation
for installing LSB format packages.
</PARA>

<PARA>
FIXME: somewhere we need a guide/script for how to build packages
which conform.  RPM will need options for the dependencies and to
force version 3 (if you have RPM 4.x).  Similarly if alien or other
tools are being used to build packages.
</PARA>
</SECT1>

<SECT1>
<TITLE>Package Naming Conventions</TITLE>
<PARA>
Packages should follow these rules for creating their names. This will enable
the use of package dependencies by LSB conforming packages.
</PARA>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Package Naming</TITLE>
<PARA>
Package names must be registered with the Linux Assigned Numbers Authority.
</PARA>

<PARA>
FIXME: any constraints on versions?
</PARA>
</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Package Dependencies</TITLE>
<PARA>
Packages must depend on a dependency "lsb".  They may not depend on
other system-provided dependencies.  If a package includes "Provides"
it must only provide a virtual package name which is registered to
that application.
</PARA>

<PARA>
FIXME: what about depending on versions?
