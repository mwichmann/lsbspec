<TITLE>Cron Jobs</TITLE>
<PARA>
Packages may not touch the configuration file <FILENAME>/etc/crontab</FILENAME>,
nor may they modify the files in <FILENAME>/var/spool/cron/crontabs</FILENAME>.
</PARA>
<PARA>
If a package wants to install a job that has to be executed via cron,
it shall place a file in one of the
following directories:
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
/etc/cron.daily
/etc/cron.weekly
/etc/cron.monthly
</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>
As these directory names say, the files within them are executed on a
daily, weekly, or monthly basis, respectively.
See below for the rules concerning the names of these files.
</PARA>
<PARA>

If a certain job has to be executed more frequently than `daily,' the
package shall install a file
<FILENAME>/etc/cron.d/<replaceable>cron-name</replaceable></FILENAME>
tagged as configuration file. This file uses the same syntax as
<FILENAME>/etc/crontab</FILENAME> and is processed by cron automatically.
</PARA>
<PARA>
It is recommended that files installed in any of these directories be
scripts (shell scripts, Perl scripts, etc.) so that they may be
modified by the local system administrator. In addition, they must be
registered as configuration file.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The scripts in these directories have to check, if all necessary
programs are installed before they try to execute them. Otherwise,
problems will arise when a package was removed (but not purged), since
the configuration files are kept on the system in this situation.
</PARA>

<PARA>
To avoid namespace conflicts in the /etc/cron.* directories, the filenames
used by LSB-compliant packages in /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly, 
/etc/cron.monthly, or /etc/cron.d must come from a managed namespace.
These filenames may be assigned using one of the following methods:
</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST MARK="bullet">
<LISTITEM><PARA>
	Assigned namespace.  This namespace consists of names which
		only use the character set [a-z0-9].  
		In order to avoid conflicts these cron script
		names must be reserved
		through the Linux Assigned Names and Numbers
		Authority (LANANA).
		Information about the LANANA
		may be found at
		<ULINK URL="http://www.lanana.org">www.lanana.org</ULINK>.
	</PARA>

	<PARA>
		Commonly used names shall be reserved in advance; 
		developers for projects should be encouraged reserve names
		from LANA, so that each distribution can use the same
		name, and to avoid conflicts with other projects.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
	Hierarchical namespace.  This namespace consists of scripts
		names which look like this: [hier1]-[hier2]-...-[name],
		where name is again taken the character set [a-z0-9], 
		and where there may be one or more [hier-n] components.  
		[hier1] may either be an LSB provider name assigned
		by the LANANA, or
		it may be owners' DNS name in lower case, with at
		least one '.'.  I.e., "debian.org", "staroffice.sun.com", etc.
		The LSB provider name assigned by LANANA 
		must only consist of the ASCII characters [a-z0-9].
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
	Reserved namespace.  This namespace consists of script names
		which begin with the character '_', and is reserved for
		distribution use only.  This namespace should be used
		for core packages only, and in general use of this
		namespace is highly discouraged.
