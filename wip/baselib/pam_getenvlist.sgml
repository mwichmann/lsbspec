<PARA>
  This function returns a pointer to the complete PAM environment.
  It is a pointer to a read-only list of read-only environment
  variables.  It should be noted that this memory will become invalid
  after a call to pam_end(), If an application wishes to make use of this
  list after such a call, it should first make a copy of all the set variables.
</PARA>
