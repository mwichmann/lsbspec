<TITLE>Description
</TITLE>
<PARA>
  This function is used to initialize the PAM library. It must be called prior
  to any other usage of the PAM library.  Following a successful return
  the contents of <PARAMETER>*pamh</PARAMETER> is a handle that provides
  continuity for successive calls to the PAM library. The arguments
  expected by pam_start are as follows: the <PARAMETER>service_name</PARAMETER>
  of the program, the <PARAMETER>username</PARAMETER> of the individual to be
  authenticated, a pointer to an application-supplied
  <STRUCTNAME>pam_conv</STRUCTNAME> structure and a pointer to a
  <VARNAME>pam_handle_t</VARNAME> pointer.
</PARA>
<PARA>
  An application must provide a ``conversation function''. It is used
  for direct communication between a loaded module and the application
  and will typically provide a means for the module to prompt the user
  for a password etc. . The structure, pam_conv, is defined to be,
</PARA>
<SCREEN>
  struct pam_conv {
    int (*conv) (int num_msg,
                 const struct pam_message * *msg,
                 struct pam_response * *resp,
                 void *appdata_ptr);
    void *appdata_ptr;
  };
</SCREEN>
<PARA>
  It is initialized by the application before it is passed to the
  library.  The contents of this structure are attached to the
  <PARAMETER>*pamh</PARAMETER> handle. The point of this argument is to
  provide a mechanism for any loaded module to interact directly with the
  application program. This is why it is called a conversation structure.
</PARA>
<PARA>
  When a module calls the referenced conv() function, the argument
  <PARAMETER>*appdata_ptr</PARAMETER> is set to the second element of this
  structure.
</PARA>
<PARA>
  The other arguments of a call to conv() concern the information
  exchanged by module and application. The first parameter,
  <PARAMETER>num_msg</PARAMETER> holds the length of the array of
  pointers passed via, <PARAMETER>msg</PARAMETER>. After a successful return,
  the pointer <PARAMETER>resp</PARAMETER> points to an array of
  <PARAMETER>num_msg</PARAMETER> <STRUCTNAME>pam_response</STRUCTNAME>
  structures, holding the application supplied text.  Note, *resp is an
  struct pam_response array and not an array of pointers.
