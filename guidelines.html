<h1>
Spec Guidelines</h1>
The following is a definition of what constitutes a stable standard. This
should be applied to both what we produce, and what we reference by our
standard. This is a guideine and does not prevent the LSB from making
exceptions as needed.
<h3>
Published Specification</h3>
A standard should be published for public use. The standard may be published
at a well know location on the web, preferably under the web site of a
formal organization (as is described later). Publication under someone's
personal web space is discouraged as doing so does not present an image
of permanence.
<h3>
Versioned Specification</h3>
A specification should be adequately versioned.&nbsp; All specifications
should have achieved a 1.0 status. Proper versioning implies that the specification
is developed with
<br>enough controls to ensure stability. The specification should not be
versioned rapidly. A high rate of change does not imply a stable specification.
<h3>
Complete Specification</h3>
The specification should be complete in that is covers all interfaces that
are part of the command or API. The specification should explicitly define
the behavior of all interfaces. The specification should be written in
a manner that is conducive to extracting a set of assertions from which
a test suite can be developed. The specification should be complete enough to
allow a compatible implementation to be independently developed.
<h3>
Specification Committee</h3>

The specification should be developed by a committee or group. The committee
or group should include representatives from multiple vendors or organization.
The group should be open to new membership.
The group should have well defined processes making progress and resolving
issues. The group should have a roadmap defined for the specification.
