<TITLE>Facility names</TITLE>

<PARA>
Facility names that begin with a dollar sign ('$') are system facility
names, defined by the LSB, and MUST be provided by distributions.  LSB
applications should not provide system facilities.  This document
defines the following system facility names:
</PARA>

<SIMPLELIST type=horiz columns=2>
<MEMBER>$local_fs</MEMBER>	
<MEMBER>all remote filesystems are mounted</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$network</MEMBER>  	
<MEMBER>low level networking (ethernet card; may
imply PCMCIA running)</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$named</MEMBER>  	
<MEMBER>named is operational</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$remote_fs</MEMBER>	
<MEMBER>all remote filesystems are mounted (note
in some cases /usr may be remote.  Most
applications that care will probably require
both $local_fs and $remote_fs)</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$syslog</MEMBER>
<MEMBER>system logger is operational</MEMBER>

<MEMBER>$netdaemons</MEMBER>
<MEMBER>all network daemons are running</MEMBER>

</SIMPLELIST>

<PARA>
Other system facilities may be defined by other LSB applications.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Facility names may also be init.d script names, although LSB
applications SHOULD NOT use script names, especially script names which
are provided by distributions, as these may not necessarily be the same
across different distributions.
