<TITLE>Installation of init.d files</TITLE>

<PARA>
An init.d file is installed by copying it into /etc/init.d (which may
be a symlink to another location).  This can be done by the package
installer.  During the package's postinstall script, the program
"/usr/lib/lsb/install_initd" to configure the distribution's boot
script system to call the package's init.d file at the appropriate
time.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The install_initd program takes a single argument, the pathanme to the
/etc/init.d file.  For example:
</PARA>

<SCREEN>
	/usr/lib/lsb/install_initd /etc/init.d/inet
</SCREEN>


<PARA>
There should be a tool available to the user (ala RedHat's chkconfig)
which can be used by the system administrator to easily manipulate at
which init levels a particular init.d script is started or stopped.
This specification currently does not specify such an interface,
however.  (XXX should it?)
