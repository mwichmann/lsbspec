Are the argument types and return type for htonl uint32_t (if so where
is that defined?) or unsigned long?  The manpage on my system says the
latter.  Need to check Single Unix Spec.

Need to write manpages for all the functions which don't already have
a reference to another standard (Also, how do we extract a list of
such functions from the database).
