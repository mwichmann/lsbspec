To complete transitions in progress:

LSB-Core books driven from Core:
- copy LSB/{arch}/intro chapters to Core
- keep old, remove bits not relating to Base
- make sure "new" intro material includes stuff from ELF,Packaging,Security
- switch to using "new" intros in core builds

- Add appendix chapters to other books (all have entities already)
