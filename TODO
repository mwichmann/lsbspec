To complete transitions in progress:

LSB-Core books driven from Core:
- clean up LSB intro bits, remove stuff not relating to Base
- make sure "new" (Core) intro material includes stuff from ELF,Packaging,Security
- rename LSB to Base


Other cleanups:

intros that will become specifications include preface.sgml.  it would
be cleaner is other intros included a matching modpreface.sgml, those
all have text inline in the intro.m4 file now.

design a way to handle pre-release vs. release builds, currently
commenting out one chunk or another in intro.m4 (or preface.sgml)
is done.  This means someone has to remember to edit those.  easier
if previous item is done (modpreface.sgml), then there are fewer
places to edit, but still...
