<TITLE>Data Definitions for libncurses</TITLE>
<PARA>
This section defines global identifiers and their values that are associated
with interfaces contained in libncurses.
These definitions are organized into groups that
correspond to system headers. This convention is used as a
convenience for the reader, and does not imply the existence
of these headers, or their content.
Where an interface is defined as requiring a particular system header file
all of the data definitions for that system header file presented here shall be in effect.
</PARA>
<PARA>
This section gives data definitions to promote binary application
portability, not to repeat source interface definitions available
elsewhere. System providers and application developers should use this ABI
to supplement - not to replace - source interface definition specifications.
</PARA>
<PARA>
This specification uses the <XREF LINKEND='std.ISOC99'> C Language as the reference programming language, and data definitions are specified in ISO C format. The C language is used here as a convenient notation. Using a C language description of these data objects does not preclude their use by other programming languages.</PARA>
