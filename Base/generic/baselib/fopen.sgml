<!--
NOTE this file is no longer used ...
The differences to POSIX were removed in the move from the 2.2 kernel
to 2.4. All 2.4 and later kernels return ENXIO everywhere that POSIX
says they should. Therefore, this diff is no longer required....

<title>Description</title>

<para>
<function>fopen</function> is as specified in 
<XREF LINKEND=STD.SUSv4>, but with differences as listed below.
</para>

<refsect2>
<title>May return <errorname>ENODEV</errorname> in 
place of <errorname>ENXIO</errorname>
</title>
<para>

Where the <XREF LINKEND=STD.SUSv4> specifies an <errorname>ENXIO</errorname> return, the
implementation may return either <errorname>ENXIO</errorname> or
<errorname>ENODEV</errorname>.  Implementations are
encouraged to return <errorname>ENXIO</errorname>.
<note>
<para>
As of spring 2004, we don't know of any Linux kernel patches to switch
to <errorname>ENXIO</errorname>, but we believe that such a kernel patch would be accepted if
submitted.
