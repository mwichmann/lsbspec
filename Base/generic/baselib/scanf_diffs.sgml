<PARA>
The 
<literal>%s</literal>, 
<literal>%S</literal> and 
<literal>%[</literal> conversion specifiers shall accept an 
option length modifier
<literal>a</literal>, 
which shall cause a memory buffer to be allocated to hold the string converted.
In such a case, the argument corresponding to the conversion specifier should be
a reference to a pointer value that will receive a pointer to the allocated
buffer. If there is insufficient memory to allocate a buffer, the 
function may set 
<varname>errno</varname> to <errorcode>ENOMEM</errorcode> and a 
conversion error results.
<note>
<para>This directly conflicts with the <xref linkend="std.ISOC99"> usage of
<literal>%a</literal> as a conversion specifier for hexadecimal float
values. While this conversion specifier should be supported, a format
specifier such as <literal>"%aseconds"</literal> will have a different
meaning on an LSB conforming system.
