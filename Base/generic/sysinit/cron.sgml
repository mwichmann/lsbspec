<PARA>
In addition to the individual user <filename>crontab</filename> files specified
by <xref linkend=std.SUSv4>, which are located in
<filename>/var/spool/cron</filename> as specified by the
<xref linkend="std.fhs"> (FHS),
the process that executes scheduled commands shall also process the following
additional <filename>crontab</filename> files, which are in a
different format (see below).
<SIMPLELIST type=inline>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/crontab</FILENAME></MEMBER>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.d/*</FILENAME></MEMBER>
</SIMPLELIST>.
The installation of a package shall not modify
the crontab file <FILENAME>/etc/crontab</FILENAME>,
and shall not directly modify the user crontab files in
<FILENAME>/var/spool/cron/crontabs</FILENAME>. but may
use the <command>crontab</command> command to modify the latter.
</PARA>
<PARA>
If a package wishes to install a job that has to be executed periodically,
it shall place an executable <FirstTerm>cron script</FirstTerm> in one of the
following directories:
</PARA>
<SIMPLELIST>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.hourly</FILENAME></MEMBER>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.daily</FILENAME></MEMBER>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.weekly</FILENAME></MEMBER>
<MEMBER><FILENAME>/etc/cron.monthly</FILENAME></MEMBER>
</SIMPLELIST>
<PARA>
As these directory names suggest, the files within them are executed on a
hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly basis, respectively, under the control of an
entry in one of the system <filename>crontab</filename> files, at an
unspecified time of day.
See below for the rules concerning the names of cron scripts.
</PARA>

<NOTE>
<PARA>
It is recommended that cron scripts installed in any of these directories be
script files rather than compiled binaries so that they may be
modified by the local system administrator. Conforming applications
may only install cron scripts which use an interpreter required by
this specification or provided by this or another conforming application.
</PARA>
<PARA>
This specification does not define the concept of a package
<FirstTerm>upgrade</FirstTerm>. Implementations may do different
things when packages are upgraded, including not replacing a
cron script if it marked as a configuration file,
particularly if the cron script appears to have been modified since
installation.  In some circumstances, the cron script may
not be removed when the package is uninstalled. 
Applications should design their installation
procedure and cron scripts to be robust in the face of such
behavior.  In particular, cron scripts should not fail obscurely
if run in unexpected circumstances. Testing for the existence
of application binaries before executing them is suggested.

<PARA>
Future versions of this specification may remove the need to install
file directly into these directories, and instead abstract the interface
to the <command>cron</command> utility in such a way as to hide the 
implementation. Please see <XREF LINKEND=future-directions-annex>.
</PARA>

</NOTE>
<PARA>
If a certain task has to be executed at other than the predefined
frequencies, the package shall install a file
<FILENAME>/etc/cron.d/<replaceable>cron-name</replaceable></FILENAME>.
The file shall have  the same format as that described for the 
<command>crontab</command> command in <xref linkend="std.SUSv4">, except that 
there shall be an additional field, <parameter>username</parameter>, before
the name of the command to execute. For completeness, the seven fields shall
be:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Minute [0,59]</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Hour [0,23]</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Day of the month [1,31]</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Month of the year [1,12]</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Day of the week [0,6] (with 0=Sunday)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Username</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>command [args ...]</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

This file shall be processed by the system automatically, with the named
command being run at the specified time, as the specified username.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Applications installing files in these directories shall use the
LSB naming conventions (see <xref linkend="fhs-name-rules">).
