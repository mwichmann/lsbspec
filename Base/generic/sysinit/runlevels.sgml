<TITLE>Run Levels</TITLE>

<PARA>
The following <FirstTerm>run levels</FirstTerm> are specified for use by the 
<command>Default-Start</command> and <command>Default-Stop</command> 
actions defined in <xref linkend="initscrcomconv"> as hints
to the <command>install_initd</command> command.
Conforming implementations are not required to provide these exact
run levels or give them the meanings described here,
and may map any level described here to a different level which
provides the equivalent functionality. Applications may not depend
on specific run-level numbers.

<para>
These run levels were chosen as reflecting the most frequent existing
practice, and in the absence of other considerations, implementors are
strongly encouraged to follow this convention to provide consistency
for system administrators who need to work with multiple distributions.
