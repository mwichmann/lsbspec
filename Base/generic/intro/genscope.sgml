<para>
The Linux Standard Base (LSB) defines a system interface for compiled
applications and a minimal environment for support of installation scripts.
Its purpose is to enable a uniform industry standard environment for
high-volume applications conforming to the LSB.
</para>

<para>
These specifications are composed of two basic parts: A common part
describing those parts of the interface that
remain constant across all implementations of the LSB, and an
architecture-specific part describing the
parts of the interface that vary by processor architecture.
Together, the common part and the relevant
architecture-specific part for a single hardware architecture provide a
complete interface specification for compiled application programs on systems
that share a common hardware architecture.
</para>

<para>
The LSB contains both a set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs)
and Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs). APIs may appear in the
source code of portable applications, while the compiled binary of that
application may use the larger set of ABIs. A conforming implementation
provides all of the ABIs listed here. The compilation system may
replace (e.g. by macro definition) certain APIs with calls to one or
more of the underlying binary interfaces, and may insert calls to binary
interfaces as needed.
</para>

<para>
The LSB is primarily a binary interface
definition. Not all of the source level APIs available to applications
may be contained in this specification.
