<TITLE>File System Hierarchy</TITLE>
<PARA>
An LSB conforming implementation shall provide the mandatory portions of the
file system hierarchy specified in the <XREF LINKEND="STD.FHS"> (FHS),
together with any additional requirements made in this specification.
</PARA>
<PARA>
An LSB conforming application shall conform to the <XREF LINKEND="STD.FHS">.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The FHS allows many components or subsystems to be optional. An application
shall check for the existence of an optional component before using it, and
should behave in a reasonable manner if the optional component is not
present.
</PARA>
<para>
The FHS requirement to locate the operating system kernel in either
<filename>/</filename> or <filename>/boot</filename> does not apply if
the operating system kernel does not exist as a file in the file system.
</para>
<para>
The FHS specifies certain behaviors for a variety of commands if they
are present (for example, <command>ping</command> or <command>python</command>).
However, conforming applications
shall not rely on any commands beyond those required by this specification.
The mere existence of a command may not be used as an indication that the
command behaves in any particular way.
</para>
<para>
The following directories or links need not be present:
<filename>/etc/X11</filename> 
<filename>/usr/bin/X11</filename>
<filename>/usr/lib/X11</filename>
<filename>/proc</filename>

<PARA>
The devices described in 
Chapter 6. "Operating System Specific Annex",
Section 6.1. "Linux", subsection 6.1.3. "/dev: Devices and special files"
in the <xref linkend="std.fhs"> are required on an LSB conforming system.
Other devices may also exist in <FILENAME>/dev</FILENAME>. 
Device names may exist as symbolic links to other device nodes
located in <FILENAME>/dev</FILENAME> or
subdirectories of <FILENAME>/dev</FILENAME>.
There is no requirement concerning major/minor number values.

In addition to the requirements for <filename>/etc</filename> in the

following directories or symbolic links to directories:

<listitem><para>A directory containing shell scripts. 
Script names should follow the same conventions
as specified for cron jobs (see <xref linkend="cronjobs">, but should
have the suffix <filename>.sh</filename>.
The behavior is unspecified if a script is installed in this directory that
does not have the suffix <filename>.sh</filename>.</para>

The <command>sh</command> utility
shall read and execute commands in its current execution environment 
from all the shell scripts in this directory that have the suffix <filename>.sh</filename>
when invoked as an interactive login shell,
or if the <parameter>-l</parameter> (the letter <emphasis>ell</emphasis>)

<NOTE>
<TITLE>Future Directions</TITLE>
<PARA>
These directories are required at this version of the LSB since there is not
yet an agreed method for abstracting the implementation so that applications
need not be aware of these locations during installation. <!-- However,
<XREF LINKEND="future-directions-annex">
describes a tool, <command>lsbinstall</command>, that will make these
directories implementation specific and no longer required. -->

<SECT2 ID="FHS-NAME-RULES" xreflabel="File Naming Conventions">
<TITLE>File Naming Conventions</TITLE>
<PARA>
Conforming implementations and applications installing files into any
of the above locations under
<filename>/etc</filename> may only use filenames
from the following managed namespaces:
<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
<listitem>
<para>
Assigned names.  Such names must be chosen from
the character set <literal>[a-z0-9]</literal>.
In order to avoid conflicts these 
names shall be registered. This specification establishes
a registry of provider, package and script names which is maintained
at the Linux Assigned Names and Numbers Authority (LANANA).
See <ulink url="http://www.lanana.org">www.lanana.org</ulink>
to register names or look up already registered names.
</para>

<note><para>
Commonly used names should be registered to avoid conflicts
and promote name reuse across distributions.
Project developers are encouraged to reserve names with the LANANA
as early as possible as registration is on a first-come,
first-served basis.
</para></note>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Hierarchical names.  Script names in this category take the form: 
<filename>&lt;hier1&gt;-&lt;hier2&gt;-...-&lt;name&gt;</filename>,
where name is taken from the character set 
<literal>[a-z0-9],</literal> 
and where there may be one or more 
<filename>&lt;hier-<replaceable>n</replaceable>&gt;</filename> components.  
<filename>&lt;hier1&gt;</filename> may either be an LSB provider name 
registered with the LANANA,
or it may be a domain name registered to the provider in the DNS system,
containing at least one <literal>'.'</literal>
(e.g. "<literal>debian.org</literal>", "<literal>staroffice.sun.com</literal>").
The LSB provider name registered with the LANANA 
shall only consist of the ASCII characters <literal>[a-z0-9]</literal>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Reserved names.  Names that
begin with the character '<literal>_</literal>' are reserved for
distribution use only.  Names in this form should be used
for essential system packages only.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<note><para>
As this specification cannot enforce rules for applications which
do not choose to conform to it, conforming applications need to be
aware that the managed namespaces may have been polluted 
with unregistered filenames and should check
for namespace collisions and take appropriate steps if they occur.
</para>

<para>
In general, if a package or system script is likely to be used
on multiple systems, the package developers or the distribution should
register the name through the LANANA, and distributions should strive to
use the same name whenever possible.  For applications which may not
be essential or may not be commonly installed, the hierarchical namespace
may be more appropriate.  An advantage to the hierarchical namespace
is that there is no need to consult with the LANANA before using a 
specific name.
</para>

<para>
Short names are highly desirable, since system
administrators may wish to manually start and stop services.
Given this, they should be standardized on a per-package basis.  This
is the rationale behind having the LANANA organization assign these
names.  The LANANA may be called upon to handle other namespace issues,
such as package/prerequisites naming.
