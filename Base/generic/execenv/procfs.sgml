This file is a text file that contains information about one or more
processors. A blank line separates the information for each processor.
Each processor is described by an unordered set of lines. Each line contains
a key followed by a seperator followed by a value. The key may be any
combination of alphanumeric, underscore, and space characters. The separator
is a tab followed by a colon followed by a space ('\t: '). The format of the
value is defined below, and in architecture-specific LSB specifications.
