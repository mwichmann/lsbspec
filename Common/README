Source directory for LSB-Common

New for LSB 5.0

Unlike the other major specification books, LSB-Common does not reflect an
LSB module.  Rather, it is an introductory overview book created because
for some things it is easier to read a general description than to look
up a certain element in every book.

In the initial release it describes the libraries assigned to each
module, the conformance requirements, and the "package name" details -
the packaging dependency names and lsb_release names used to reflect a
dependency on each module.
