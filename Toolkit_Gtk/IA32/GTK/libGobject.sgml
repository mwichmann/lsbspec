<TITLE>Data Definitions for libgobject-2.0</TITLE>
<PARA>
This section defines global identifiers and their values that are associated
with interfaces contained in libgobject-2.0.
These definitions are organized into groups that
correspond to system headers. This convention is used as a
convenience for the reader, and does not imply the existence
of these headers, or their content.
Where an interface is defined as requiring a particular system header file
all of the data definitions for that system header file presented here shall be in effect.
</PARA>
<PARA>
This section gives data definitions to promote binary application
portability, not to repeat source interface definitions available
elsewhere. System providers and application developers should use this ABI
to supplement - not to replace - source interface definition specifications.
</PARA>
<PARA>
This specification uses the <XREF LINKEND='std.ISOC99'> C Language as the reference programming language, and data definitions are specified in ISO C format. The C language is used here as a convenient notation. Using a C language description of these data objects does not preclude their use by other programming languages.</PARA>
