Criteria for inclusion in the LSB

<LI>
A stable Standard must exist. The standard itself should be versioned, and
   new releases should not be released too frequently (6 months is probably a
   minimum time between releases). Frequent releases often indicates a lack of
   maturity or an incompletness of the standard. The standard must be published
   and be reasonable easy to obtain. It is preferable that the standard be 
   freely available, but nominal charges are acceptable. If published on the    
   web it should be published at a location that it likely to remain stable.
   Personal web space on an ISP or employers website is often not sufficiently
   stable.
<LI>
A Sample Implementation must exist. Code needs to be in the hands of the
   people that will be using it. The code should have accumulated some runtime
   on it to shake out any bugs. It would be premature to adopt a spec for code
   that hasn't been proven.
<LI>
A Test suite must exist. A significant aspect of the LSB is the ability to
   measure a system or an application and prove that it conforms to the
   specification. Test suites are the foundation of this ability. Exceptions
   to this rule have been made as part of the bootstrapping process of the
   LSB, but future exception will be fewer and farther apart.
<LI>
There must be a demonstrated need. A component must be of general use,
   which can be demonstrated by its use in multiple pakages. Typically, it
   isn't a good investment of time to specify an API which is only used by
   one or two programs. ISV requirements as mentioned above in 2b) will help
   us be proactive in this area.
