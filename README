This directory contains the tools necessary for converting the LSB
booksets into the PDF that is submitted to ISO.

The output of the docbook build process includes the rtfspec (make rtfspec)
in Rich Text format. Unfortunately, OpenOffice does not handle this
very well (though it makes a reasonable go at it!). Therefore, the current
procedure is:

1	make rtfspec	(in each of the lsbspec/booksets/LSB-Core-xxx
			 directories)
2	copy the rtf file to a Windows system
3	open it in M$ Word (make sure your default printer is PostScript)
4	use the included ISO_LSB.bas macros (the only public
			 macro is convert_doc)
5	copy the resulting .ps file back to a Linux system with ghostscript
6	cd refspec/LSB_X.Y.Z/ISO
7	run ps2pdf on the PostScript
8	cvs add -kb LSB_Core_xxx.pdf; cvs commit

Easy!
