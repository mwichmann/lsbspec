<TITLE>Script names</TITLE>

<PARA>
Since the init.d scripts must live in a single directory, they must be
come from a single namespace.  Three means of assigning names from
this namespace are available:
</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST MARK="bullet">
<LISTITEM><PARA>
	Assigned namespace.  This namespace consists of names which
		only use the character set [a-z0-9].  This space is
		desireable for scripts which system administrators may
		often wish to run manually: e.g., "/etc/init.d/named restart"
		In order to avoid conflicts these names must be reserved
		through the LANA (Linux Assigned Names/Numbers Authority).
	</PARA>

	<PARA>
		Commonly used names shall be reserved in advance; 
		developers for projects should be encouraged reserve names
		from LANA, so that each distribution can use the same
		name, and to avoid conflicts with other projcts.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
	Hierarchical namespace.  This namespace consists of scripts
		names which look like this: [hier1]-[hier2]-...-[name],
		where name is again taken the character set [a-z0-9], 
		and where there may be one or more [hier-n] components.  
		[hier1] may either be a [a-z0-9] name assigned by the LANA, or
		it may be owners' DNS name in lower case, with at
		least one '.'.  I.e., "debian.org", "staroffice.sun.com", etc.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
	Reserved namespace.  This namespace consists of script names
		which begin with the character '_', and is reserved for
		distribution use only.  This namespace should be used
		for core packages only, and in general use of this
		namespace is highly discouraged.  

</PARA></LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>


<PARA>
In general, if a package or some system function is likely to be used
on multiple systems, the package developers or the distribution SHOULD
get a registered name through LANA, and disrtibutions should strive to
use the same name whenever possible.  For applications which may not
be "core" or may not be commonly installed, the hierarchical namespace
may be more appropriate.  An advantage to the hierarchical namespace
is that there is no need to consult with the LANA before obtaining an
assigned name.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Obviously, short names are highly desireable, since many system
administrators like to use them to manually start and stop services.
Given this, they should be standardized on a per-package basis.  This
is the rationale behind having a LANA organization to assign these
names.  The LANA may be called upon to handle other namespace issues,
such as package/prequiresites naming (which I'm sure will be a hot
political topic, but essential to make prerequisites to work
correctly).
</PARA>

<PARA>
This specification shall pre-define the following script names as:

	apmd atd crond dhclient dhcpcd gpm halt identd inet
	httpd kudzu klogd lpd mcserv named nfs nfslock pcmcia
	portmap random routed rstatd rusersd rwhod sendmail smb
	snmpd sshd syslog xfs xntpd ypbind
</PARA>

<PARA>
XXX Note: we don't have to agree exactly how all of these scripts
work.  This is true especially of the low-level system names such as
syslog and klogd.  If some distributions put both in syslog, and some
separate them out, this isn't a big deal; we just need to reserve the
names.
</PARA>

<PARA>
XXX Some of these packages, such as sshd, aren't currently being
distributed by distributions, but may in the future.  For those we
need more definition, but it's still not much more than saying which
package they are associated with.
</PARA>
